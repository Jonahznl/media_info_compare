CytcAXVBCiM,2023-10-22 18:00:43,GraphImage,"Ending months of silence, George Santos began an unusual dialogue with a reporter he had long avoided.

In December, The New York Times published an exposé that revealed how the Republican congressman had falsified his background on the campaign trail. By now, the biographical fictions are well known: the jobs at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs that he never had, the Baruch and NYU degrees he never obtained and the volleyball team he never played on. There were also unresolved fraud charges in Brazil — a precursor to what would soon follow.

Santos now faces 23 felony counts — including 10 new ones added this month — for a variety of financial schemes, many of which involve his campaign. He has pleaded not guilty.

The strike hit a mosque in the densely packed Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin in the northern West Bank. Israel’s military said it was targeting an underground “terror compound” beneath the mosque that it said was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to organize an imminent attack. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, called the activity beneath the mosque a “ticking time bomb.” The claims had not been independently verified.

At least two people were killed and three others were injured, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Video from the scene showed significant damage to the mosque.

About 17% of New Zealand’s population identifies as Maori.

It has also been clouded in controversy.

Federal law enforcement agents raided the temple construction site in 2021 after workers accused the builders, a prominent Hindu sect with ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and his ruling party, of forced labor, low wages and poor working conditions. Their lawyers said workers who were Dalit, the lowest rung in India’s caste system, were specifically targeted. A federal criminal investigation is ongoing, as is a wage claim lawsuit.

In the meantime, the temple, which sits on 180 acres and includes 10,000 statues and spires nearly 200 feet tall, is attracting visitors by the thousands, some there to view the elaborate architecture and design, others for a more spiritual experience.

The state has sent away more than 50,000 migrants, helping to provoke a shelter crisis in several U.S. cities like Denver and Chicago that has reshaped the debate over immigration.

The program is now an organized migrant transportation system that helps alleviate the strain of new arrivals on small border cities at a cost of roughly $75 million, and that number is growing. Still, it has not succeeded in what is perhaps Abbott’s biggest goal: forcing the federal government to adopt more stringent border controls, favored by Republicans.

Now, Abbott is trying to change Texas law to make crossing the border from Mexico without authorization a state crime, allowing the police in Texas to arrest people coming across the Rio Grande, including asylum seekers. The State Senate passed the bill this month during a special legislative session, though it has yet to be approved by the Texas House.

Thirty years ago, when he moved into a Brooklyn townhouse, he planted two baby pawpaw trees. Despite growing up and down the East Coast and being North America’s largest native edible fruit, the pawpaw is undersung and difficult to source. The trees take at least three years – sometimes as long as 10 – to bear fruit. And then it has a brief season— generally limited to September— and a shelf life of only three to five days. The fruit bruises easily, making it a poor candidate for conventional grocery stores. 

In spite of these quirks — or perhaps because of them — the pawpaw enjoys a small but devoted following. Farzan has become something of an evangelist, an active member of seven pawpaw-centric groups on Facebook, where he gladly shares his wisdom with newcomers.

Many of the limestone villas and high-rise buildings surrounding the hospital have been reduced to piles of rubble and concrete. The Israeli Army claims that the neighborhood is a financial hub for Hamas, making it a target of airstrikes.

In addition to the aerial assault unleashed on the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip, Israel has said it is blocking water, electricity and fuel from entering the enclave, contributing to the shutdown of the territory’s only power station.

CyWJt-KxoTH,2023-10-13 16:43:23,GraphImage,"Over the past few decades, evidence has been mounting that the average human body temperature is not really 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Instead, most people’s baseline is a little bit cooler.

The standard of 98.6 was established over 150 years ago by the German physician Dr. Carl Wunderlich, who reportedly took over a million measurements from 25,000 people. Temperatures ranged from 97.2 to 99.5, and the average was 98.6. Dr. Wunderlich also established 100.4 degrees as “probably febrile.”

But a new study that evaluated the temperatures of more than 126,000 people between 2008 and 2017 found that the average is cooler than the number we all learned in health class.

The department’s schools had the highest outcomes in the country for Black and Hispanic students, whose eighth-grade reading scores outpaced national averages for white students.

While the achievement of U.S. students overall has stagnated over the past decade, the military’s schools have made gains on the national test since 2013. And even as the country’s lowest-performing students — in the bottom 25th percentile — have slipped further behind, the Defense Department’s lowest-performing students have improved in fourth-grade math and eighth-grade reading.

How does the military do it? In large part by operating a school system that is insulated from many of the problems plaguing American education. Defense Department schools are well-funded, socioeconomically and racially integrated and have a centralized structure that is not subject to the whims of school boards or mayors.

Since then, breaking has mostly faded from hip-hop’s forefront in the U.S. But now, the New York City-born dance style is preparing for its biggest international spotlight yet, when it debuts at the Olympic Games in Paris next year. 

The new platform has left both pioneers and younger breakers to grapple with issues of authenticity that some of hip-hop’s other tenets have already confronted. Some breakers are concerned that the Olympics will strip the soul from the struggle that breaking sprung from, and contend that breaking is an art form, not a sport. Others argue that hip-hop is already overly commodified, commercialized and disfigured; its authenticity distilled in fragmented pockets. And New York is left to ponder its place as breaking preps for its largest audience yet.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warned on Sunday of a “long and difficult war” ahead, a day after Palestinian militants launched one of the biggest attacks on the country in years from the Gaza Strip. Thousands of rockets were fired into central and southern parts of Israel as heavily armed gunmen crossed border fences into Israeli communities.

Israel responded with heavy airstrikes on Gazan cities, which continued into Sunday morning. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, continued to fire rockets into Israel overnight.

A senior Israeli defense official said that an early assessment showed that about 600 Israelis were believed to have been killed on Saturday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly. At least 370 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

President Biden on Saturday condemned the surprise assault, warning Iran and other nations hostile to Israel not to join the fighting.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ordered a call-up of reservists after Palestinian militants fired thousands of rockets, invaded several Israeli towns and took hostages. Nearly 300 people have been killed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.

The Israeli military said that the militants had entered at least 22 Israeli towns and abducted soldiers and civilians, including an older grandmother. Residents of Israeli border towns told broadcasters that gunmen were moving door to door, looking for civilians. Unverified footage appeared to show Palestinian fighters transporting captured Israeli civilians and bodies through the Gaza Strip.

The timing of the assault, at one of the most difficult moments in Israel’s history, was striking. It followed months of profound anxiety in Israel about the cohesion of its society and the readiness of its military, a crisis set off by the government’s efforts to reduce the power of the judiciary.

By early evening, the Israeli military said fighting continued in at least five places in southern Israel, around 70 Israelis had been reported dead by emergency medical groups, and Israel had retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities. At least 198 Palestinians were killed in either gun battles or airstrikes, the Gazan Health Ministry said.

The Hamas militants behind the attack also took Israelis hostage, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said.

Despite its water-damaged interior — a warren of cramped bedrooms and leaky bathrooms once occupied by priests — the artist felt strongly that the building, which dates to around 1907, should remain standing, as a part of the area’s history. But she also aspired to give it a new life as a family home and studio.

Once the contractor’s team began peeling back layers of plaster, they found that the joists were rotten and that the whole interior had to be demolished. But the artist and the architects came to see this discovery as liberating — it freed them to create an entirely new layout.

Democrats joined with a small group of hard-liners in McCarthy’s own party to strip the California Republican of the speaker’s gavel in a 216 to 210 vote. It was the culmination of a bitter power struggle between McCarthy and members of a far-right faction who tried to block his ascent to the speakership in January and have tormented him ever since, trying to stymie his efforts to keep the government funded and the nation from defaulting on its debt.

So far this year, close calls involving commercial airlines have been happening, on average, multiple times a week, according to a Times analysis. In July alone, at least 46 close calls involving commercial airlines were recorded.

Several earn enough on the platform to make their passion for film a full-time job, a feat amid continuous cuts to arts critic positions in newsrooms.

But the new school of film critics doesn’t see much of itself in the old one. And some tenets of the profession — such as rendering judgments or making claims that go beyond one’s personal taste — are now considered antiquated and objectionable.

Katalin Karikó grew up in Hungary, daughter of a butcher. She decided she wanted to be a scientist, although she had never met one. She moved to the U.S. in her 20s, and for decades never found a permanent position or earned more than $60,000 a year.

Now Karikó, 66, has emerged as one of the heroes of Covid-19 vaccine development. Her work, with her close collaborator, Dr. Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania, laid the foundation for the stunningly successful vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. On Monday, they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their research.

To make it happen, NASA is going to build houses on the moon that can be used not just by astronauts, but by ordinary civilians as well. The agency believes that by 2040 Americans will have their first subdivision in space. Living on Mars isn’t far behind. Some in the scientific community say NASA’s timeline is overly ambitious, particularly before a proven success with a new lunar landing. But seven NASA scientists interviewed for this article said that a 2040 goal for lunar structures is attainable if the agency can continue to hit its benchmarks.

The center, which turned 50 this year, is singular among the state’s 52 state parks in that its draw is not landscape and nature. 

“Our resource here is the people,” said Keith Symanowitz, the park’s promotions director. “Our mission here is to perpetuate, present and promote the Ozark way of life.” The staff does so by giving the people of the region, which is rural and largely white, a place to do the things they’ve always done — and visitors can watch and even try those things themselves: making quilts, brooms, knives and home remedies; carving wood, forging iron, tanning and shaping leather; weaving and dyeing fabric.

Though Mountain View’s economy depends to a large extent on tourism, the place is authentic. People there are living their lives as they always have, not because they think you will find it enchanting, but because that is what they do and they like doing it.

Butler has been a fixture in California politics for nearly 15 years as a former leader of the state’s largest labor union and an adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2021, she became the first Black woman to take the helm at Emily’s List, the fund-raising powerhouse dedicated to electing female candidates and supporters of reproductive rights. Senator Feinstein died at 90 on Thursday. 

In choosing Butler, who is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday, Newsom followed through on a pledge he made more than two years ago to name a Black woman to the Senate if a vacancy were to emerge.

This year, Paltrow was roundly mocked online for a filmed interview in which she talked about intermittent fasting and her seemingly stringent diet. In March, spectators took note of every outfit she wore (mostly from Goop’s G Label) in her trial for a 2016 skiing collision in Utah. Her 2014 post on her divorce from the Coldplay singer Chris Martin delivered the phrase “conscious uncoupling” to the world.

Goop, which encompasses a whole constellation of healthy-ish, wellness-flavored brands, is celebrating its 15th anniversary. It’s derided by critics (in September 2018 Goop settled a false-advertising lawsuit brought by district attorneys in California) as much as it’s adored by fans. As an entrepreneur, Paltrow may wield more power than she ever did when she was regularly acting.

Will the prospective buildings impose a weight limit, as they often do? Will Great Danes be on a list of forbidden breeds, as they frequently are? Will the management charge a monthly pet rent that can be as high as $100? Will it insist on meeting your dog, and if so, will there be chemistry?

Canine owners and experts agree that it is not the size of the dog that matters in city apartments, but the animal’s disposition and needs. 

But building rules aside, what’s it actually like sharing a small apartment with a large canine roommate? And what breeds might make better apartment dogs than others?
