It was specially designed to protect against a range of incoming short-range threats.

The Iron Dome uses radar to identify and destroy incoming threats before they can cause damage.

It can differentiate between missiles likely to hit built-up areas and those that won't. Static and mobile units only launch interceptor missiles to shoot down anything interpreted as dangerous.

The system became operational in 2011 and was developed by Israel with some US support.
