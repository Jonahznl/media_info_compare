The $2.3 billion Sphere—a Las Vegas entertainment venue—is just one of the 200 inventions that made this year's list. 

Sphere's 366-ft.-tall exterior is earth’s biggest LED screen. Inside it boasts a 160,000-sq.-ft. curved screen and an advanced concert-grade audio system, both now put to use for a residency by U2. 

When Sphere first lit up on July 4, “it was like something out of a sci-fi movie,” says David Dibble, CEO of MSG Ventures, which developed the venue's tech. ""People got out of their cars and were just staring up.”

Time,Cyiqb6BMmgb,2023-10-18 13:20:13,GraphSidecar,"Saher Alghorra has long loved to document both the beauty and challenges of life in Gaza. That’s what first drove the 27-year-old Gaza native to become a photojournalist. But even Alghorra—who has already lived through the devastating 2008 and 2014 Gaza-Israel conflicts—was not prepared for what has transpired this month. “The humanitarian situation here is extremely catastrophic,” Alghorra tells TIME.

Alghorra’s photographs show how Israeli airstrikes continue to overwhelm the 2.2 million Palestinians living in what is one of the world’s most densely populated places. Families grieve next to lifeless bodies. Plumes of smoke fill the sky. Rubble fills the streets. Patients inundate Al-Shifa, the city’s largest medical complex, as thousands more seek shelter there. Homes are destroyed every day. “They are reduced to dismembered bodies inside,” he says.

And those who live have not escaped the trauma. Alghorra recalls meeting two children at the emergency room at Al-Quds hospital who had lost their father while escaping airstrikes. “They sat there crying. We tried to help find [him],” he says. Alghorra followed them until they finally found him injured in a different part of the hospital. “They hugged each other and collapsed in tears.”

At the center of both narratives is the sinister series of murders of members of the Osage Nation that took place in early 1920s Oklahoma. Known as the ""Reign of Terror,"" the murders were committed at a point in time when the Osage were considered the richest people per capita in the world following the discovery of oil reserves under their land.

But while Grann's account largely focuses on how the crimes against the Osage came to be investigated and partially solved by a team of FBI field agents led by former Texas Ranger Tom White (played by Jesse Plemons in the movie), Scorsese shifts the spotlight to the story of love and betrayal at the heart of the tragedy.

The fifth season of Netflix’s #LoveIsBlind turned out to be a season that couldn’t even put a happy face on its so-called social experiment by marrying off one reasonably sympathetic couple.

After a relatively low-conflict fourth season that resulted in three marriages out of four couples, fans have been savoring the drama of the show’s latest episodes, featuring singles from Houston.

Yet, when you remember that there are real people behind the breathless headlines, the show’s soapy mess keeps getting harder to enjoy. And as the deceptions, delusions, and alleged abuses of this past season of ‘Love Is Blind’ have underscored, nothing good can come of so much reality-TV artifice masquerading as true romance.

“It seems fair to conclude that the highly stage-managed environment of reality dating just isn’t healthy,” Berman writes, for the contestants, or the viewers.

In an ambiguous separation, the couple has not committed to parting ways, nor to figuring how to live together. Some therapists say this situation is more common than people might think.

Studies have suggested that between 6% and 18% of still-married American couples have been through a period of separation. 

There are many reasons people separate but don't divorce. ""It's hard, emotionally, for people to get divorced,"" says matrimonial lawyer Paul Talbert. ""It's harder than just saying we're going to separate and try this out.""

For celebrity couples, there are reputations to be managed. ""For many couples, divorce means public acknowledgement of failure,"" says Dr. Scott Haltzman, therapist and author of several books on marriage.

Time,CyghtPZxrW2,2023-10-17 17:25:27,GraphSidecar,"Since the Israeli military issued an order last week for the 1.1 million Palestinians living in northern Gaza to flee south, in an apparent prelude to its anticipated ground invasion, a mass exodus has ensued. While those with enough fuel have made the journey by car or truck, others have hitched rides on trailers and donkey carts. Some have even resorted to making the perilous journey on foot.

This kind of mass relocation of civilians amid regular airstrikes was never going to be easy. Both the United Nations and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders dubbed the task “impossible,” citing the logistical nightmare of relocating half of Gaza’s population—among them women, children, and the elderly—without any guarantees for their safety. Indeed, there have been reports by the Financial Times and others of at least one designated safe route out of northern Gaza being subject to an airstrike resulting in as many as 70 deaths. Hamas blames Israel for the attack—a charge that the IDF denies. 

“What’s being done doesn’t meet the legal standards for what an evacuation should entail,” Shaina Low, a communications adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council, tells TIME from the NEC’s office in East Jerusalem. “It should be orderly; there should be safety.” Indeed, while Israel may order an evacuation for imperative military reasons or to protect civilians, international law requires that it provides those being displaced with adequate shelter, hygiene, health, safety, and nutrition.

In Gaza, all of these things have been in short supply since Israel began its bombardment of the densely-populated Strip in retaliation for Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, in which militants killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Since then, Gaza has been under complete siege, cut off from food, water, and electricity. Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 2,670 people, roughly a quarter of them children.

Time,Cyd_zVdssQR,2023-10-16 17:50:42,GraphSidecar,"Before mining came to Chhattisgarh, a landlocked state in central India, Hasdeo Arand was a remote forest with a dozen tribal hamlets. Spanning more than 650 square miles, the forest is often called the “lungs of central India” and is home to endangered elephants, sloth bears, and leopards, as well as valuable water reserves. Many of the local villagers are Adivasis, or “original inhabitants” hailing from the Gond tribe, who cultivate crops in their backyards and sell woven grass baskets at the market. For them, this land is sacred.

The area’s nearly 250 plant and bird species aren’t the forest’s only resources. Umeshwar Singh Armo remembers when, as a schoolboy, he learned about another one: a shiny substance called “coal.” But it wasn’t until 2007 that surveyors sent by the state government began roaming the forest, using satellite cameras and laser scans to look for the stuff.

What the surveyors found was a miner’s jackpot: more than 5 billion tons of coal sitting under the pristine forest. In 2013, Chhattisgarh’s government marked out coal blocks, or designated areas for mining, and gave approval to Rajasthan, another state government, to extract the fuel. The Rajasthan government contracted the mining operations to Adani Power, India’s largest private operator and developer of coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Shortly after, a chunk of the forest roughly the size of five football fields was torn out to establish the Parsa-East Kanta Basan (PEKB) mine, named after two hamlets that once stood on the land. Today, what remains are large black craters.

India is pulling back on coal, but the damage is already done.

The model and actor, who first burst into mainstream consciousness as the bombshell breakout star of tUncut Gems, has never shied away from telling her unvarnished truth, whether on her podcast Forbidden Fruits or on TikTok, where she may detail for her 1.7 million followers anecdotes from a high-profile romance or offer a down-to-earth tour of her relatively modest New York City apartment.

Now, with her new memoir, Down the Drain, Fox makes a case for herself as one of her generation’s most authentic storytellers, cutting through niche fame and viral moments with a clarion voice and a worldly-wise sensibility honed from the thrills and near-death experiences she’s witnessed during her 33 years of life.

Time,CyXyoq2uRVd,2023-10-14 08:00:13,GraphSidecar,"Over the last 30 years, 60 countries have liberalized abortion law, with only four rolling back its legality: the U.S., Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Poland. 

Officially in 2020, there were seven maternal deaths in Poland. In 2021, there were nine. 

Such low figures have persisted for more than a decade, but experts say the data is unreliable. 

“Every year we estimate that there are almost three times as many deaths as appear in the statistics. If a patient dies in the intensive care unit, for example, and not in the gynecology and obstetrics department, nothing in the certificate will link her death to the pregnancy,” says Dr. Katarzyna Szamotulska, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at the Mother and Child Institute in Warsaw. (Poland’s Ministry of Health declined to answer multiple requests for comment about the reliability of the statistics.) 

With doctors reluctant to intervene, infant mortality rates have also risen, says Dr. Gizela Jagielska, the deputy director of the public hospital in Olesnica and a gynecologist who performs many of the few legal abortions that still take place in Poland.

Time,CyWOUWguPth,2023-10-13 17:23:37,GraphSidecar,"Abortion has been illegal in Poland since 1993, but a 2020 ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, which went into effect the next year, removed one of the exceptions to the law—fetal abnormalities—and imposed a near-total ban on abortion.

Now women can terminate a pregnancy only if the women’s life or health is at risk (including mental health risks with a psychiatric diagnosis) or if there is reasonable suspicion that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

Yet what the law allows is not actually what is happening in practice, as examples from across the country indicate. The consequences of the reproductive-rights rollback have been dire.

Women who have abortions are not prosecuted under the law, but doctors and others who help women terminate pregnancies, up to the point of viability, may face up to three years in prison. If an abortion takes place beyond the point of viability, then the person who aided in the abortion may face up to eight years in prison. 

This creates what many consider a “chilling effect,” as doctors scared of running afoul of the law hesitate to take lifesaving steps for pregnant patients.

These conditions were ""not compatible with life outside the womb,"" a doctor told Phillips.

But Phillips, who lives in north Tennessee, could not get an abortion in her home state. She had two options: she could continue her pregnancy and put her own health at significant risk, or she could travel out of state to terminate it.

Now she has half a million followers and has made it her mission to alert women to proactive solutions that they can start implementing even during pregnancy. 

She rarely uses obscure medical terminology and tries to infuse humor into her posts, whether they involve her squatting over a toilet making exaggeratedly strained faces to demonstrate what not to do or showing off kitschy knitted vulvas she ordered online. She shimmies to the latest viral pop song while explaining how to properly wash a vulva (with just water!). Her Instagram page contains a lot of basic information that can be revelatory: Busy women, she says, often rush and push to pee, unwittingly damaging their pelvic floor.
