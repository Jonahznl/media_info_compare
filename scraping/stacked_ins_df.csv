But as much as it may feel imperative to stay fully engaged in the tragic updates and charged conversations like those about Israel and Gaza, doing so without boundaries may lead to compassion fatigue, said Dr. Rebecca Sachs, a clinical psychologist based in New York City.

The term was created to capture the experience of people in caretaking roles or professions ‚Äî such as therapists, firefighters, police officers, emergency room health care professionals and family members caring for someone with a chronic condition, said Dr. Charles Figley, Kurzweg Distinguished Chair in Disaster Mental Health at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Those who are watching traumatic things unfold in communities they are connected to as well as those they empathize with from afar may also feel the impact of compassion fatigue, Sachs said. That can lead to exhaustion, irritability and difficulty continuing to engage with their empathy if not attended to, Sachs said.

The video shows a projectile streaking through the darkened skies over Gaza and exploding in the air. Seconds later, another explosion is seen on the ground.

The footage has become a widely cited piece of evidence as Israeli and American officials have made the case that an errant Palestinian rocket malfunctioned in the sky, fell to the ground and caused a deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

But a detailed visual analysis by The New York Times concludes that the video clip ‚Äî taken from an Al Jazeera television camera livestreaming on the night of Oct. 17 ‚Äî shows something else. The projectile seen in the video is most likely not what caused the explosion at the hospital. It actually detonated in the sky roughly two miles away, The Times found, and is an unrelated aspect of the fighting that unfolded over the Israeli-Gaza border that night.

The Times‚Äôs finding does not answer what did cause the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital blast, or who is responsible. The contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch is to blame remains plausible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.

The hospital blast has become a searing, contested episode in the war that began on Oct. 7, after Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, invaded Israel, killing more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers and seizing 200 hostages who were taken back to Gaza, according to the Israeli government. Israel has responded with a relentless artillery and bombing campaign that has killed 5,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.

Israel subsequently denied being at fault and blamed an errant rocket launch by the Palestinian faction group Islamic Jihad, which has in turn denied responsibility.

The Times‚Äôs initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage ‚Äî and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels ‚Äî relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified.

The state has sent away more than 50,000 migrants, helping to provoke a shelter crisis in several U.S. cities like Denver and Chicago that has reshaped the debate over immigration.

The program is now an organized migrant transportation system that helps alleviate the strain of new arrivals on small border cities at a cost of roughly $75 million, and that number is growing. Still, it has not succeeded in what is perhaps Abbott‚Äôs biggest goal: forcing the federal government to adopt more stringent border controls, favored by Republicans.

Now, Abbott is trying to change Texas law to make crossing the border from Mexico without authorization a state crime, allowing the police in Texas to arrest people coming across the Rio Grande, including asylum seekers. The State Senate passed the bill this month during a special legislative session, though it has yet to be approved by the Texas House.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ordered a call-up of reservists after Palestinian militants fired thousands of rockets, invaded several Israeli towns and took hostages. Nearly 300 people have been killed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.

The Israeli military said that the militants had entered at least 22 Israeli towns and abducted soldiers and civilians, including an older grandmother. Residents of Israeli border towns told broadcasters that gunmen were moving door to door, looking for civilians. Unverified footage appeared to show Palestinian fighters transporting captured Israeli civilians and bodies through the Gaza Strip.

The timing of the assault, at one of the most difficult moments in Israel‚Äôs history, was striking. It followed months of profound anxiety in Israel about the cohesion of its society and the readiness of its military, a crisis set off by the government‚Äôs efforts to reduce the power of the judiciary. And the violence came 50 years and a day after the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Israel was also surprised by a complex Arab attack, leading to huge Israeli losses and soul-searching about the state of the country.

By early evening, the Israeli military said fighting continued in at least five places in southern Israel, around 70 Israelis had been reported dead by emergency medical groups, and Israel had retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities. At least 198 Palestinians were killed in either gun battles or airstrikes, the Gazan Health Ministry said.

The Hamas militants behind the attack also took Israelis hostage, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said. 

In an assault without recent precedent in its complexity and scale, the militants crossed into Israel by land, sea and air, according to the Israeli military, leading to some of the first pitched battles between large groups of Israeli and Arab forces on Israeli soil in decades. As of early evening there were the two main battles taking place, near the towns of Ofakim and Beeri, Admiral Hagai said.

‚ÄúOur resource here is the people,‚Äù said Keith Symanowitz, the park‚Äôs promotions director. ‚ÄúOur mission here is to perpetuate, present and promote the Ozark way of life.‚Äù The staff does so by giving the people of the region, which is rural and largely white, a place to do the things they‚Äôve always done ‚Äî and visitors can watch and even try those things themselves: making quilts, brooms, knives and home remedies; carving wood, forging iron, tanning and shaping leather; weaving and dyeing fabric.

Though Mountain View‚Äôs economy depends to a large extent on tourism, the place is authentic. People there are living their lives as they always have, not because they think you will find it enchanting, but because that is what they do and they like doing it.

Butler has been a fixture in California politics for nearly 15 years as a former leader of the state‚Äôs largest labor union and an adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2021, she became the first Black woman to take the helm at Emily‚Äôs List, the fund-raising powerhouse dedicated to electing female candidates and supporters of reproductive rights. Senator Feinstein died at 90 on Thursday. 

In choosing Butler, who is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday, Newsom followed through on a pledge he made more than two years ago to name a Black woman to the Senate if a vacancy were to emerge.

In March, spectators took note of every outfit she wore (mostly from Goop‚Äôs G Label) in her trial for a 2016 skiing collision in Utah. Her 2014 post on her divorce from the Coldplay singer Chris Martin delivered the phrase ‚Äúconscious uncoupling‚Äù to the world.

Goop, which encompasses a whole constellation of healthy-ish, wellness-flavored brands, is celebrating its 15th anniversary.

Chandler was nearly Perry‚Äôs double: a tortured loner for whom cynicism was body armor. He died prematurely on Saturday, at 54.

Flip, sarcastic and allergic to attachment, Perry typified the Gen X sensibility in his 10 years as Chandler. Our age cohort (I was born in 1966, Perry three years later) has frequently been dismissed as nondescript, but what is special about us has become apparent in retrospect. We were the last generation to grow up predigital, meaning spoken conversation was our default means of communication. We were scarred by divorce, which peaked when we were kids, like no generation before or since. Many of us sought to build replacement families out of pals living close at hand, taking dorm living as our model.

Perry‚Äôs portrayal of Chandler was informed by revealing conversations he had with the show‚Äôs writers. Unlike Matt LeBlanc‚Äôs Joey Tribbiani (a caricature of a brainless actor) and David Schwimmer‚Äôs Ross Geller (painfully earnest and therefore not typical of a generation that venerates irony), Chandler was the perpetual wry observer, wisecracking from a distance.

His cynicism and sarcasm were a reflection of our own outlook on life.

‚Å†
Allowing people to stay on the streets means likely injury or death in a city that experiences an average of 20 days annually below zero degrees Fahrenheit.

WSJ,Cy3kHuuNK6p,2023-10-26 16:09:10,GraphImage,"One of the most durable forces shaping the U.S. electorate is that voters tend to lean more Republican as they age.‚Å†
‚Å†
But it also matters where they begin on the political spectrum, and there are indications that millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z started out more liberal than prior generations. That has made them a crucial base of support for Democrats, even as some other groups of voters have moved away from the party.‚Å†
‚Å†
Gaining assets and income pushes voters toward conservative fiscal policies, such as lower taxes, that allow them to keep more of their money, researchers say. As Americans move from midlife to retirement, they are more likely to favor stability over change, and less likely to back liberal policies that upset the social order.‚Å†
‚Å†
This rightward shift is likely to affect who wins elections in 2024 and the years beyond. One in six Americans is age 65 or over, up from one in eight a decade prior, according to the most recent decennial census. A slump in births that started in 2008 will eventually give way to a smaller pool of new, young voters.‚Å†
‚Å†
On its face, the shift bodes well for Republicans. Yet its effects have been muted by the size and liberal bent of millennials now approaching middle age, and the more solidly blue partisanship of Gen Z voters just entering the electorate.‚Å†

The news affirmed a decadeslong quest to steer consumers away from a drug that he long-believed didn‚Äôt work.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hendeles, a retired professor, with his friend, fellow pharmacist and University of Florida professor Randy Hatton, have spent nearly 20 years following the science of phenylephrine, an ingredient in more than 200 over-the-counter decongestants.‚Å†
‚Å†
Last month, following a petition from Hatton and Hendeles, an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration weighed studies examining oral phenylephrine‚Äôs power to unblock sinuses and clear stuffy noses, and unanimously determined that it wasn‚Äôt effective.‚Å†

WSJ,CyzJlrEt8bM,2023-10-24 23:00:25,GraphImage,"More than a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, one thing seems clear: New state bans have done little so far to deter women from obtaining abortions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Data released Tuesday shows the number of abortions ticked up slightly in the year following the high court‚Äôs Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization decision. That ruling, from June 2022, ended federal protections for the procedure, and paved the way for some 16 states to ban many or most abortions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The data indicate that abortion providers, funders and others have adapted quickly to a legal landscape that has changed profoundly. Access has been cut off throughout much of the South, and demand has surged in states in which abortion is still legal. Many providers there have had to significantly increase capacity. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In the new study, WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, found that nationwide there were 183 more monthly abortions on average in the 12-month period following the Dobbs decision compared with the monthly average prior to the decision. ‚Å†
‚Å†
While it has become much harder since the end of Roe to obtain an abortion in states with newly enacted bans, it actually appears to have become easier in many other states, thanks to increased attention and resources. Abortion funds, nonprofits that help finance abortions and logistics associated with them, have raised millions to help lower-income women pay for procedures and travel, while new clinics have opened in states such as Illinois and New Mexico that have become major destinations for women traveling from other states. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Nearly 115,000 fewer abortions were performed in the year after the Dobbs decision in states that banned abortions throughout pregnancy or after six weeks, according to the WeCount data. At the same time, states including Illinois, Florida and North Carolina‚Äîwhere the procedure remained largely legal‚Äîsaw an increase of 117,000 abortions. ‚Å†

‚Å†
Ghanaian refugee John Ekow boarded a vessel in July in the Ivory Coast with the prospect of making landfall in the U.S. There was just one problem: the ship was bound for Brazil.‚Å†
‚Å†
Brazilian officials have been bedeviled by a new phenomenon: a small but growing number of African migrants who completed a perilous 2,000-mile journey from West Africa after sneaking onto cargo ships they believed were actually headed for Europe or the U.S.‚Å†
‚Å†
Some African arrivals say criminal gangs and fishermen in West Africa tricked them into boarding the wrong ships, charging a small fee to hoist them aboard, including onto narrow platforms behind the ship‚Äôs rudder, according to researchers and authorities studying clandestine immigration. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI was gutted,‚Äù Ekow said, describing the moment the ship‚Äôs captain told him he was not in the U.S. but in Macap√°, Brazil, where the Atlantic meets the Amazon River.‚Å†
‚Å†
The 24-year-old and a friend boarded the ship in Abidjan with the help of a local fisherman. During the trip the men huddled together for warmth, rationing out tins of sardines and a bottled mush of cassava flour and water. By the third day, the food was gone. By the fifth, they ran out of water.‚Å†
‚Å†
On the seventh day, the ship suddenly slowed down. Police officers at the port of Macap√° said they could either go back to Africa or stay in Brazil and file for asylum, Ekow said. Both opted for the latter. His friend, who had brought a fistful of dollars with him, told Ekow he was going to try and trudge to the U.S.‚Å†
‚Å†
A total of 234 migrants arrived in Brazil as stowaways between 2006 and 2017, almost exclusively from Africa, hidden in ships that docked in at least 15 different states along Brazil‚Äôs almost 5,000-mile coastline, according to the latest available data from the country‚Äôs navy. ‚Å†

‚Å†
‚ÄúI have extreme confidence,‚Äù the Florida Republican said in an interview from his Capitol Hill office, ‚Äúthat we will have an upgrade at the position.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The House has had no speaker since Gaetz made a motion to vacate the position, then joined on Oct. 3 with seven other Republicans and 208 Democrats to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) from the role. Rep. Jim Jordan, the archconservative Ohio Republican whom Gaetz calls a mentor, this week failed on three ballots to secure the majority of the body‚Äôs votes, losing support on each roll call and then bowing out of the race Friday afternoon. No one else seems to have a clear path to 217 GOP votes for the position. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Many of his colleagues blame Gaetz for the paralysis and acrimony that have ensued. When Gaetz rose to speak in a closed-door party meeting on Thursday, McCarthy told him to ‚Äúsit your ass down,‚Äù and another Republican, Rep. Mike Bost of Illinois, cursed and lunged at Gaetz.‚Å†
‚Å†
Asked about the encounter afterward, McCarthy told reporters, ‚ÄúListen, the whole country, I think, would scream at Matt Gaetz right now.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The upheavals that have racked the House GOP since January are less a reflection of any coherent faction than one man‚Äôs singular will. It was Gaetz who took it upon himself to block McCarthy from the speakership in January, joining with 19 others to deny him a majority until he agreed to crippling concessions. One of those was the ability for a single member to bring the motion to vacate, which Gaetz then deployed to remove McCarthy this month.‚Å†
‚Å†
While critics accuse Gaetz of attention-mongering, he insists he is about outcomes, not headlines. He says he has received a flood of approving feedback from conservatives across the country.‚Å†

Research is making clearer the role that genes play in living to very old age. Habits like getting enough sleep, exercising and eating a healthy diet can help you stave off disease and live longer, yet when it comes to living beyond 90, genetics start to play a trump card, say researchers who study aging.‚Å†
‚Å†
About 25% of your ability to live to 90 is determined by genetics, says Dr. Thomas Perls, a professor of medicine at Boston University who leads the New England Centenarian Study. By age 100, it‚Äôs roughly 50% genetic, he estimates, and by around 106, it‚Äôs 75%.‚Å†

Centenarians make up a growing share of the U.S. population. There are about 109,000 centenarians living in the country in 2023, according to Census Bureau projections, up from about 65,000 10 years ago, thanks in part to decades of advances in medicine and public health.‚Å†

Knowing what enables some people to live very long lives has consequences for the rest of us. Ongoing research into very old age may help provide insight that could eventually be used to develop drugs or identify lifestyle changes to help people live healthier for longer, says Dr. James Kirkland, president of the American Federation for Aging Research.‚Å†

The Journal found hundreds of merchants offering the new drug, which is being developed by Eli Lilly and is called retatrutide. Most appear to be Chinese sellers shipping directly to U.S. consumers from sites such as Made-in-China.com.

In August, the Journal reported that more than 50 websites were selling knockoff semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in Ozempic and Mounjaro respectively.

‚Å†
Sales of previously owned homes in 2023 are expected to dwindle to a rate not seen since at least 2011, when the U.S. population was smaller and the country was still recovering from one of the worst housing crises ever, according to many economist forecasts.‚Å†
‚Å†
Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real-estate brokerage Redfin, estimated that total existing-home sales in 2023 would amount to around 4.1 million, which would mark the smallest number of sales since about 2008, the year that Lehman Brothers collapsed and sparked the global financial crisis. Zhao said sales are unlikely to pick up much next year, with mortgage rates likely to remain at elevated levels. ‚Å†
‚Å†
This year‚Äôs housing slowdown is very different from the previous one, after the housing bubble of the early 2000s burst. Back then, the economy entered a deep recession and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure. ‚Å†
‚Å†
This time around, home sales have been slowing for more than a year because of rising borrowing costs, record-high home prices and a very limited inventory of homes for sale. ‚Å†
‚Å†
If existing-home sales for the full year end up even lower than expected at fewer than four million, that would mark the first drop below that level since 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors. ‚Å†

‚Å†
The documents from Remington Arms‚Äîwhich was part of a firearms conglomerate called Freedom Group‚Äîare being disclosed by a lawyer who obtained them in a lawsuit filed by parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Last year they settled with Remington, which made the AR-15 used by the killer, for $73 million. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Digital replicas of real guns have appeared in numerous videogames, and executives from both industries have acknowledged they signed partnerships for that purpose. But they haven‚Äôt disclosed the details of such deals or discussed the motivations behind them.‚Å†
‚Å†
The documents, from the late 2000s and early 2010s, show Remington and Freedom Group officials pursued deals to place their guns in shooter videogames as part of a marketing push for new audiences because they were concerned their customer base was aging.‚Å†
‚Å†
Executives at the gun giant, which was owned by private-equity company Cerberus and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, believed such deals would ‚Äúhelp create brand preference among the next generation,‚Äù and allow the company to ‚Äúwin our fair-share of these young consumers,‚Äù according to an undated Freedom Group memo titled ‚ÄúGaming Strategy.‚Äù‚Å†

Gradually you discover millions of people across the U.S. are in the same situation‚Äìone that will bring months or years of rebuilding. A gigantic solar storm has hit Earth. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The odds are low that in any given year a storm big enough to cause effects this widespread will happen. And the severity of those impacts will depend on many factors, including the state of our planet‚Äôs magnetic field on that day. But it‚Äôs a near certainty that some form of this catastrophe will happen someday, says Ian Cohen, a chief scientist who studies heliophysics at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.‚Å†
‚Å†
To get ahead of this threat, a loose federation of U.S. and international government agencies, and hundreds of scientists affiliated with those bodies, have begun working on how to make predictions about what our Sun might do. And a small but growing cadre of scientists argue that artificial intelligence will be an essential component of efforts to give us advance notice of such a storm.‚Å†
‚Å†
The most dangerous of these solar storms is known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME, when a gargantuan blob of charged particles is catapulted from the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere by rapidly shifting magnetic fields, at speeds in excess of 8,000 times that of sound. These happen often, but we‚Äôre rarely aware of them because they only affect us when they happen to strike earth.‚Å†
‚Å†
Satellites that orbit high above Earth in so-called geostationary orbit would be the first to feel the effects. In theory, they can be incapacitated by ‚Äúkiller electrons‚Äù more common during certain kinds of solar storms. The electrons can penetrate satellites, and the resulting charge can build up, damaging electronics. Losing these satellites could cause worldwide disruption of GPS services.‚Å†

‚Å†
Although rents are still generally higher than they were prepandemic, local real-estate agents said the velocity of people moving to Miami has slowed and there are fewer people willing to overpay. Meanwhile, newly built apartments are adding thousands of rental units to the market, further easing the supply-demand imbalance that has characterized the market over the past few years.‚Å†

Hamas fighters on the ground explicitly targeted Israeli civilians for killing. Israelis were shot while driving along the street. They were pulled from their homes and killed. Hamas carried out the mass murder of some 260 people at the Tribe of Nova music festival.

Vladimir Putin, a purported friend of Israel, has said little, other than blaming a failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East. No surprise there. What Hamas did to the Israelis is what Putin has been doing to civilians in Ukraine for almost two years.

Since the February 2022 invasion, it is estimated that about 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. Russia has killed hundreds with missiles fired into residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns. It has targeted schools, hospitals and food markets.

These civilian deaths‚Äîby Hamas in Israel and Russia in Ukraine‚Äîare not collateral damage from urban warfare. They are part of the war plan, thought out by calm men sitting around a table, in Moscow or Beirut, looking at maps and civilian targets. Crimes against humanity are becoming normalized.

Our adversaries‚ÄîRussia, Iran, China and North Korea‚Äîwill continue the mass killing of civilians and hostage-taking as a strategic policy until the U.S. decisively counters this awful new normal.

‚Å†
Houston, Dallas and Austin top the list of major U.S. cities with the highest office-vacancy rates, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics. About 25% of their office space wasn‚Äôt leased as of the third quarter. That was more than double New York‚Äôs vacancy rate of 12% and well above San Francisco‚Äôs vacancy rate of 17%.‚Å†

Texas office floors are struggling to find tenants even though the state‚Äôs workers have been more eager to get back to the office than in most other places. According to Kastle Systems, which measures occupancy by counting keycard swipes in 10 major metro areas, Houston, Austin and Dallas have the highest office-return rates.‚Å†
‚Å†
Vacancies are high largely because Texas developers build too much. All three cities experienced a surge in construction in the 1980s, when tax rules favored developers and loose lending created a commercial real-estate bubble. Another construction spurt in the late 1990s aggravated the problem.‚Å†
‚Å†
Texas‚Äô high vacancy rate offers more evidence that the U.S. office market‚Äôs biggest problem hasn‚Äôt been primarily remote work. It is a glut of buildings across the U.S., which has been decades in the making and helps explain why the country has long had much higher vacancy rates than Europe or Asia.

The younger Arnault is learning the ropes of his father‚Äôs luxury‚Äôs empire, and Louis Vuitton has bet on the 24-year-old to turn the brand into a player in high-end, mechanical watchmaking.‚Å†
‚Å†
Jean was standing in a gilded, mirrored room of Paris‚Äôs Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay showing off Louis Vuitton‚Äôs newest watch model to a clutch of experts one July morning. The thin unisex watch, named the Tambour, was the result of almost two years of work. But the most valuable Tambour in the building wasn‚Äôt on display with the others. It was on Arnault‚Äôs wrist.‚Å†
‚Å†
His version was made of the rare metal tantalum. Tantalum gave the watch its gunmetal color, though the metal‚Äôs hardness also meant that the watch took twice as much time to manufacture. This made it ‚Äúinsanely expensive‚Äù when he bought it, Arnault said, though he refused to reveal what he paid.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only going to make one,‚Äù Arnault said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs the only one.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
Two years ago, when he first joined Louis Vuitton‚Äôs watches division as market ing and development director, Louis Vuitton watches ran a wide gamut. They ranged from watches costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to quartz timepieces that sold for around $4,000.‚Å†
‚Å†
Now Arnault has decided to eliminate the entry-level Tambours. His thinking was that instead of producing more affordable collections, Louis Vuitton needed to play in a different class. So the new iteration of the timepiece ranges in price from $18,500 to $52,000, putting it in competition with similar creations from the likes of Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin.‚Å†

Scientists who study nutrition and health say that people who lose weight on international travels are likely benefiting from two things: more daily steps while on vacation and, yes, food that is often healthier and less processed.‚Å†

Telling the truth can spark change, make your work life better and show off your own assertiveness. Or you could get fired. (At least it feels that way.)‚Å†
‚Å†
Like it or not, silence isn‚Äôt an option. But you have to be really careful about just how candid to get with the boss.‚Å†
‚Å†
The average person lies three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting someone new, according to research from Robert Feldman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

‚Å†
‚ÄúAt the end of the day, we want to hear good things,‚Äù Feldman says. ‚ÄúYour boss is just like everybody else.""‚Å†

What about when bosses want to be tapped into what‚Äôs really going on, too? After all, you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs connected to collegial chatter and gossip, which can give managers insight into how they can do a better job and get ahead. Giving the right information to your boss can help you, too. You just have to share it the right way.‚Å†
‚Å†
A smart start is to ask some questions of your own to the boss, says Matt Abrahams, who teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. What kind of guidance do they typically find useful? If they readily divulge a time they messed up or made a change, be more candid, he suggests.‚Å†

24-year-old Erica Robin, a Christian from the city of Karachi, is going to represent deeply conservative Pakistan at the Miss Universe beauty pageant.

Those criticising her nomination say she is representing a country that does not want to be represented, especially as beauty pageants are rare in Muslim-majority Pakistan.

In the competition's 72-year history, Pakistan has never nominated a representative for Miss Universe.

However Miss Pakistan World, a pageant for women of Pakistani descent from around the world, is a well-known contest, with various spin offs such as Miss Pakistan Universal, Mrs Pakistan Universal and even Miss Trans Pakistan.

It was specially designed to protect against a range of incoming short-range threats.

The Iron Dome uses radar to identify and destroy incoming threats before they can cause damage.

The system became operational in 2011 and was developed by Israel with some US support.

Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip with air strikes that have killed more than 2,800 Palestinians, a quarter of them children, and driven around half of the 2.3 million Gazans from their homes. It has imposed a total blockade on the enclave, halting food, fuel and medical supplies, which are rapidly running out.

Abdallah first began providing Reuters with footage some 16 years ago, working as a freelancer while completing his university studies.

In an ambiguous separation, the couple has not committed to parting ways, nor to figuring how to live together. Some therapists say this situation is more common than people might think.

Studies have suggested that between 6% and 18% of still-married American couples have been through a period of separation. 

There are many reasons people separate but don't divorce. ""It's hard, emotionally, for people to get divorced,"" says matrimonial lawyer Paul Talbert. ""It's harder than just saying we're going to separate and try this out.""

For celebrity couples, there are reputations to be managed. ""For many couples, divorce means public acknowledgement of failure,"" says Dr. Scott Haltzman, therapist and author of several books on marriage.

""For celebrity couples, for whom public image is the backbone of their career success, announcing the end of a marriage can impact the bottom line.""

For months, the primary culprit for the shortage was believed to be an ongoing increase in prescription rates and ADHD diagnoses, which spiked between 2020 and 2021. Adderall's active ingredient is a controlled amphetamine salt, and its production requires communication between the FDA, drug companies, and the DEA, which sets an annual cap on the amount of highly-controlled amphetamines that manufacturers can use.

Recently, however, it‚Äôs become more and more clear that something else is also going on‚Äîand that nobody wants to be responsible for figuring out what it is.

Time,CyghtPZxrW2,2023-10-17 17:25:27,GraphSidecar,"Since the Israeli military issued an order last week for the 1.1 million Palestinians living in northern Gaza to flee south, in an apparent prelude to its anticipated ground invasion, a mass exodus has ensued. While those with enough fuel have made the journey by car or truck, others have hitched rides on trailers and donkey carts. Some have even resorted to making the perilous journey on foot.

This kind of mass relocation of civilians amid regular airstrikes was never going to be easy. Both the United Nations and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders dubbed the task ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù citing the logistical nightmare of relocating half of Gaza‚Äôs population‚Äîamong them women, children, and the elderly‚Äîwithout any guarantees for their safety. Indeed, there have been reports by the Financial Times and others of at least one designated safe route out of northern Gaza being subject to an airstrike resulting in as many as 70 deaths. Hamas blames Israel for the attack‚Äîa charge that the IDF denies. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs being done doesn‚Äôt meet the legal standards for what an evacuation should entail,‚Äù Shaina Low, a communications adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council, tells TIME from the NEC‚Äôs office in East Jerusalem. ‚ÄúIt should be orderly; there should be safety.‚Äù Indeed, while Israel may order an evacuation for imperative military reasons or to protect civilians, international law requires that it provides those being displaced with adequate shelter, hygiene, health, safety, and nutrition.

In Gaza, all of these things have been in short supply since Israel began its bombardment of the densely-populated Strip in retaliation for Hamas‚Äôs Oct. 7 massacre, in which militants killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Since then, Gaza has been under complete siege, cut off from food, water, and electricity. Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 2,670 people, roughly a quarter of them children.

Spanning more than 650 square miles, the forest is often called the ‚Äúlungs of central India‚Äù and is home to endangered elephants, sloth bears, and leopards, as well as valuable water reserves. Many of the local villagers are Adivasis, or ‚Äúoriginal inhabitants‚Äù hailing from the Gond tribe, who cultivate crops in their backyards and sell woven grass baskets at the market. For them, this land is sacred.

The area‚Äôs nearly 250 plant and bird species aren‚Äôt the forest‚Äôs only resources. Umeshwar Singh Armo remembers when, as a schoolboy, he learned about another one: a shiny substance called ‚Äúcoal.‚Äù But it wasn‚Äôt until 2007 that surveyors sent by the state government began roaming the forest, using satellite cameras and laser scans to look for the stuff.

What the surveyors found was a miner‚Äôs jackpot: more than 5 billion tons of coal sitting under the pristine forest. In 2013, Chhattisgarh‚Äôs government marked out coal blocks, or designated areas for mining, and gave approval to Rajasthan, another state government, to extract the fuel. The Rajasthan government contracted the mining operations to Adani Power, India‚Äôs largest private operator and developer of coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Shortly after, a chunk of the forest roughly the size of five football fields was torn out to establish the Parsa-East Kanta Basan (PEKB) mine, named after two hamlets that once stood on the land. Today, what remains are large black craters.

India is pulling back on coal, but the damage is already done.

Officially in 2020, there were seven maternal deaths in Poland. In 2021, there were nine. 

Such low figures have persisted for more than a decade, but experts say the data is unreliable. 

‚ÄúEvery year we estimate that there are almost three times as many deaths as appear in the statistics. If a patient dies in the intensive care unit, for example, and not in the gynecology and obstetrics department, nothing in the certificate will link her death to the pregnancy,‚Äù says Dr. Katarzyna Szamotulska, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at the Mother and Child Institute in Warsaw. (Poland‚Äôs Ministry of Health declined to answer multiple requests for comment about the reliability of the statistics.)

Now women can terminate a pregnancy only if the women‚Äôs life or health is at risk (including mental health risks with a psychiatric diagnosis) or if there is reasonable suspicion that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

Yet what the law allows is not actually what is happening in practice, as examples from across the country indicate. The consequences of the reproductive-rights rollback have been dire.

Women who have abortions are not prosecuted under the law, but doctors and others who help women terminate pregnancies, up to the point of viability, may face up to three years in prison. If an abortion takes place beyond the point of viability, then the person who aided in the abortion may face up to eight years in prison. 

This creates what many consider a ‚Äúchilling effect,‚Äù as doctors scared of running afoul of the law hesitate to take lifesaving steps for pregnant patients.

""I didn't have a choice, I just naturally stood out,"" she says. ""At a certain point, instead of hiding it, I wanted to embrace it and put it at the forefront.""

Air #pollution in #Jakarta, #Indonesia, has led to a 20 to 30 percent rise in respiratory infections and pneumonia cases this year, according to the director of the country's leading respiratory hospital.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The government has taken measures to address the issue, including penalizing 13 companies for #poor operational standards, testing vehicle emissions, trimming power generation at a coal plant and implementing remote working for civil servants.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Despite these efforts, Jakarta was the world's most polluted city for several days in the previous month. Coal-fired power plants are a significant source of air pollution and are responsible for 10,500 deaths and $7.4bn in health costs in 2022.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Children are particularly vulnerable, and early exposure to pollution can lead to lifelong health issues. While Indonesia has pledged to stop commissioning new coal-fired power plants from 2023 and be carbon neutral by 2050, its progress has been slow, leading to legal action.‚Å†

Ramesh Bidhuri, the BJP MP, called Ali a ""pimp,"" a ""terrorist,"" and used the pejorative ""circumcised"" among other derogatory remarks inside the Indian parliament.‚Å†

Ali has made requests to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to condemn Bidhuri's behavior, but has received no response. Ali believes the incident shows the future of Indian democracy.‚Å†

The BJP wants a legislature without any Muslim representation and to completely suppress Muslim voices. The opposition parties have shown support for Ali, but he is still pained by the lack of condemnation from the prime minister and the ruling party.‚Å†

Ali is a believer in democracy and the parliamentary system of his country, and he hopes the people of India will have a harmonious society and teach a lesson to the hate-mongers.‚Å†

In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes had killed more than 7,000 Palestinians when this video was published on YouTube on October 27, and thousands more have been killed since in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade.

Since 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.

Today, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call ‚Äúcollective punishment‚Äù as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to the internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.

This latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what‚Äôs behind Israel‚Äôs occupation and its blockade of Gaza.

American society, with no paid leave, a fragmented care system, and minimal discussion around aging and disability, is woefully ill-equipped to support tomorrow‚Äôs caregivers.

As the baby boomer generation enters the period of life when, statistically, most people need some form of care, more millennials, as well as Gen X and Gen Z Americans, will find themselves in a position of supporting an older relative.

For many, taking on the affairs of a parent or senior relative will add pressure on top of pressure. This is in part because Americans are having kids later in life, meaning they‚Äôre more likely to find themselves caring for elderly parents and young kids at the same time. Many caregivers are also likely to face unprecedented career and financial challenges, unable to afford to quit their jobs because they don‚Äôt have the accumulated wealth necessary to cushion any prolonged period of unemployment or to shoulder a relative‚Äôs expenses.

The elder care crisis is one that many people are finding themselves facing alone, with little support from policymakers, and little public conversation to tell them about what to expect. We can help. Head to the link in bio to read our new guide to caregiving.

As the hospitals, homes, schools, and streets of the south fill up with the displaced and injured, time is running out to get lifesaving aid in ‚Äî or to help people, including hundreds of US citizens, leave.

US citizens in Gaza were told Saturday to move closer to the #Rafah border crossing, only for them to be unable to evacuate as southern Gaza becomes more and more crowded ‚Äî and runs low on basic supplies.

The status of the border crossing has been somewhat muddled; Egypt says its side remains open but that Israeli Air Force bombardments on the Gaza side of the crossing have stopped the flow of traffic and kept the border crossing closed. But Egyptian security officials also told @Reuters they are holding up the planned evacuation of some Gazans, including foreign citizens, as they await a deal to allow aid into Gaza.

‚ÄúEvery hour these supplies remain on the Egyptian side of the border, more girls and boys, women and men, especially those vulnerable or disabled, will die,‚Äù @WHO said in a statement Saturday.

But as aid negotiations continue, the question of what happens for Gazans as Israel launches its ‚Äúnext stage‚Äù of the war remains: Will powers with competing relationships and interests be able to negotiate some measure of safety for civilians, and will this next phase of the war create more Palestinian refugees, who may never be able to return to their homes?

The situation on the ground in Gaza is ‚Äúfast becoming untenable,‚Äù Martin Griffiths, the @un_ocha chief, said in a statement Saturday. 

On Monday, the Israeli government shut off Gaza‚Äôs access to water, electricity, and fuel as part of its declared siege of the region. Gaza has been under blockade by both Israel and Egypt since 2007, and access to basic goods, including food and medicine, is available only via the UN and nongovernmental organizations.

‚ÄúI fear that the worst is yet to come,‚Äù Griffiths added.

Since Hamas, the militant Islamic group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, launched an unprecedented and brutal attack against Israel that killed at least 1,300 people a week ago, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has dropped at least 6,000 bombs over Gaza. Those operations have so far killed more than 1,500 Palestinians, including civilians. Meanwhile, an IDF ground invasion seems imminent.

More than 2 million Gazans live in a strip of land the size of Philadelphia, making it one of the most densely populated places on the planet, which increases the possibility of hitting civilians during military operations. And about 42.5 percent of the population is under the age of 14, making childhood casualties common in times of conflict.

Supplies like food, fuel, medicine, and clean water are already running critically low in the region, and as of yet, since borders remain closed, there is no humanitarian corridor to get supplies into Gaza ‚Äî or get people out.

‚ÄúAmerican Jews are not a monolith. We are a tight-knit but diverse community, made up of people from different races, denominations, and political beliefs.

‚ÄúNone of this is happening in a vacuum.

Since 2017, Israel‚Äôs government has worked both to de facto annex the West Bank and rapidly expand Jewish settlement. Instead of breaking the Palestinians‚Äô spirit as intended, atrocities by emboldened settler extremists ignited Palestinian anger. And atrocities committed by Palestinians led to settler retaliation, creating an unstable situation requiring a significant redeployment of Israel Defense Forces resources to the West Bank ‚Äî whose raids themselves became a source of Palestinian grievance. And that, per the Washington Post, is why those troops weren‚Äôt on Gaza‚Äôs border. Israeli forces that should have been defending against Hamas in Gaza had been dragged to the West Bank as a consequence, at least in part, of the far right‚Äôs ideological project.

‚ÄúThe notion that Israel can deliver security for its citizens by dividing and conquering Palestinians, crushing them into submission as a kind of colonial overlord, is both immoral and counterproductive on its own terms,‚Äù Beauchamp writes. ‚ÄúRecognizing this reality will be crucial to formulating not only a humane response to Hamas‚Äôs atrocity, but an effective one.‚Äù

Oversharing in conversation is nothing new. Throughout thousands of years of social interaction, people have divulged certain secrets, vulnerabilities, and desires to perhaps the wrong listener, with results ranging from mild embarrassment to shattered reputations. Thanks to social media, the ability to make these confessions to a potentially much wider audience is easier than ever.‚Å†
‚Å†
What isn‚Äôt as straightforward is defining what constitutes oversharing online. Each platform has its specific norms and users who have their own opinions on what content they consider too cringe or vulnerable for public consumption. For instance, when people express negative emotions on Facebook, it doesn‚Äôt seem so out of place, according to a 2017 study. On the contrary, Instagram is where users expect to see positive content ‚Äî albeit content that isn‚Äôt particularly authentic. One study, from 2021, suggests the norms on TikTok empower users to embrace both difficult and positive experiences when they post.‚Å†
‚Å†
However, as social media continues to occupy an increasingly intimate space in our lives, as Ysabel Gerrard, a senior lecturer in digital communication at the University of Sheffield, thinks it will, what we post ‚Äî and how audiences interpret it ‚Äî will shift.

In particular, this question endures: Should you be friends with your kid?‚Å†
‚Å†
Part of the issue is the vagueness of the question: What does friendship with a child actually look like? Does being friends with your kids mean simply having fun together, or does it signify a relationship of equals? The American Psychological Association defines friendship as ‚Äúa voluntary relationship between two or more people that is relatively long-lasting and in which those involved tend to be concerned with meeting the others‚Äô needs and interests as well as satisfying their own desires.‚Äù Parenting, however, isn‚Äôt voluntary, and a child shouldn‚Äôt be interested in meeting their parents‚Äô needs.‚Å†
‚Å†
While experts stress the importance of a warm and supportive relationship with children, they say parents must maintain authority over their kids, which is directly at odds with the ideals of friendship. At its core, friendship is elective and equal. Once you‚Äôre a parent, there‚Äôs no opting out, making friendship not exactly appropriate for parents and their kids. So, should parents be friends with their little ones? In short: No. But you can still maintain aspects of friendship while remaining in the driver‚Äôs seat with little ones.

Israel responded by imposing a ‚Äútotal siege‚Äù on Gaza and launching air-strikes, killing more than 4,000 people according to Palestinian officials in Gaza, which has been governed by Hamas since 2007.

On Friday October 20 the Israeli Defence Forces said more than 20 children were among the hostages. It said it believed ‚Äúthe majority‚Äù of hostages were still alive.

Among those believed to be captives in Gaza are festival-attendees, children, elderly people and soldiers.

Many families have spoken out to raise awareness about their missing loved ones, while the identities of many of the hostages have not been revealed.

Many of the hostages have dual citizenship or are foreigners. The US, Germany, Thailand, Mexico, Brazil, Nepal and the UK have all reported that their citizens are missing, kidnapped, or killed.

The United States has sent a team of Special Operations forces to Israel to help with intelligence to locate the hostages, while Qatar has served as a mediator in the negotiations between Hamas, Israel, and Israel‚Äôs allies.

A ground operation into the densely populated Gaza strip to rescue the hostages could risk the lives of both those being held captive and the military, according to US and Israeli military sources. Israel believes the hostages are being held in tunnel systems beneath Gaza created by Hamas, which means it is difficult to determine their location, and they could potentially be moved.

The drought has contributed to thousands of wildfires, leaving the city of Manaus, the Amazonas state capital home to one million people, with the second worst air quality in the world. 

Amazonas recorded 2,770 wildfires so far this dry season, the highest ever recorded according to local media.

More than 1,300 people were killed in the attacks, including 247 soldiers. At least 100 hostages were taken into Gaza, while Israel said 1,500 Hamas militants were killed.

In response, Israel launched a devastating barrage of air strikes against Gaza, killing more than 1,500 people. Israel has also begun cutting off supplies of fuel, electricity and food to Gaza, in what it has called a ‚Äútotal siege‚Äù. #gaza #palestine #israel",43036,4074,True,True

The rights group said that it verified footage taken in Lebanon on Tuesday and in Gaza on Wednesday showing multiple instances of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port, and at two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.

The use of white phosphorus ‚Äì which burns when exposed to oxygen, creating intense heat and smoke ‚Äì is not banned outright in warzones under international law. The substance can be legally used on battlefields for marking targets or creating smoke screens.

But its use near civilians is prohibited under Protocol III of the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons ‚Äì although Israel has not signed the convention and is therefore not bound by it.

Human Rights Watch said the use of the white phosphorus in Gaza, one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated areas, violated the prohibitions in international humanitarian law against putting civilians at unnecessary risk.

‚ÄúAny time that white phosphorus is used in crowded civilian areas, it poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering,‚Äù said Lama Fakih, the group‚Äôs Middle East and North Africa director. ‚ÄúWhite phosphorus is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and cause egregious harm to civilians.‚Äù

The group said Israel should ban the use of ‚Äúairburst‚Äù white phosphorus munitions in populated areas, adding that there were non-lethal alternatives.

Human Rights Watch said that as well as verifying a video of the use of airburst 155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles above Gaza City, it had interviewed two witnesses in the city who had described seeing and smelling phenomena consistent with white phosphorus.

In response to the report, Israel's military told Reuters that it was ‚Äúcurrently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza,‚Äù and did not address questions around their alleged use in Lebanon. #israel #lebanon #palestine #gaza",61917,3018,True,True

Why it matters: Rising costs pose a threat to the remarkable progress that women, particularly mothers, have made in the U.S. labor force.

‚Ä¢ The report found that cost increases might be driving some parents out of the workforce to look after their children. (Typically, it's women who wind up dropping out for child care reasons, but the BofA data doesn't look at gender.)

Go deeper: The average family with child care costs spent more than $700 on it during September.

‚Ä¢ That's cutting into other things. Since May 2023, families who pay for child care have been spending at a slower pace than other households ‚Äî and dipping into savings at a higher rate.

What to watch: This data doesn't cover what's happened since the end of September, when pandemic-era federal child care funding ran out. Most observers expect costs to rise even further; and for some providers to go out of business.

‚Å†
In messages circulated on Friday, State Department staff wrote that high-level officials do not want press materials to include three specific phrases: ‚Äúde-escalation/ceasefire,‚Äù ‚Äúend to violence/bloodshed‚Äù and ‚Äúrestoring calm.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The revelation provides a stunning signal about the Biden administration‚Äôs reluctance to push for Israeli restraint as the close U.S. partner expands the offensive it launched after Hamas ‚Äï which rules Gaza ‚Äï attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7.‚Å†
‚Å†
The emails were sent hours after Israel told more than 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza that they should leave their homes and shelters ahead of an expected ground invasion of the region. On Thursday, the United Nations said Israel had given Gazans a 24-hour deadline to move to the south of the strip, adding it would be ‚Äúimpossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences.‚Äù‚Å†

Asked about Israel‚Äôs evacuation order on Friday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby declined to reject or endorse it, calling it ‚Äúa tall order.‚Äù‚Å†

Israel declared war on Hamas in response.

It has also shut off access to electricity, food, fuel and water in Gaza.‚Å†

Heiman has since learned Ditza was kidnapped by the Palestinian militant group Hamas and taken into the Gaza Strip ‚Äï and she is determined to give the world three messages.‚Å†
‚Å†
Governments worldwide should push to make sure the Hamas hostages get their medication, Heiman told HuffPost on Thursday, noting that most residents of her mother‚Äôs community were elderly people she has known ‚Äúfrom the day I was born.‚Äù‚Å†

Heiman also wants global help for those detainees to be returned to their families.‚Å†

Heiman is worried her mother could be affected by Israel‚Äôs ongoing bombardment of Gaza, a narrow, tightly packed sliver of land. Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly hit residential neighborhoods there, killing more than 1,500 people, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be preparing a ground invasion. The Israeli military on Friday ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza, which is home to over 1 million Palestinians, in what the U.N. described as an ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù task to carry out without ‚Äúdevastating humanitarian consequences.‚Äù‚Å†

‚ÄúThey are bombing Gaza, and we don‚Äôt know where she is and where all the people are,‚Äù Heiman said, referring to the scores of other hostages. ‚ÄúThey may not be in one place.‚Äù‚Å†

Heiman published an essay in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Thursday describing how her anger has multiple targets: her mother‚Äôs kidnappers but also Israeli politicians whom she blames for not doing enough to support hostages‚Äô families and for failing to establish peace with the Palestinians.‚Å†
