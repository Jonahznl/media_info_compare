In September, Pasco authorities approved a $540 million plan to add a fourth boiler to the county’s waste-to-energy facility. These plants handle highly hazardous materials, and even the cleanest operations emit federally allowable levels of noxious chemicals formed during combustion.

Proponents of the plants point out the energy they generate helps power local communities. But residents’ concerns over the potential health risks have drawn more scrutiny around the project.

Ana Vale relocated her family from Atlanta last year to a home in Doral, Florida, about 20 doors down from Miami-Dade County’s incinerator. About two weeks after moving in, her now-14-year-old daughter began complaining about her skin itching and burning. Soon afterward, a dermatologist diagnosed her with eczema.

While recent research has linked environmental toxins, including air pollution, to rising rates of eczema, Vale said her daughter’s doctor didn’t draw any conclusions about the role of the incinerator. But she believes it’s a factor.

West Virginia was among the first states to restrict some or all trans student athletes from playing on school sports teams consistent with their gender identities.

A hearing in front of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals was the most recent update in her more than two-year legal battle, which began in May 2021, when she was 11, a month after West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill that bars transgender girls from playing on girls sports teams in middle school, high school and college.

The appeals court will decide whether the law will take effect, and its decision could also start a chain of events that could land Becky’s case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Becky has been allowed to run on her school’s cross country team and throw discus and shot put on the track and field team since the appeals court reinstated a previous injunction against the law in February.

While the life expectancy for Black people is a little more than five years less than white people, when a Black person passes the 85, their life expectancy outnumbers white Americans, according to Antonius Skipper, an assistant professor at Georgia State University’s Gerontology Institute. He calls this phenomenon a mortality “crossover,” and said resilience is one of the main factors helping Black people get to this stage. 

“The strongest of the strongest tend to be those who make it to the age of 85,” Skipper said. “If you think all you’ve endured over your life course — I’ve been through racism. I’ve been through discrimination. I’ve been through all of this stuff over 85 years, I’m strong and resilient and able to get through those different things that may come at me.”

“Today’s incident is the largest single disruption to internet connectivity in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict and will be perceived by many as a total or near-total internet blackout,” Mater said. “The loss of international routes is likely to severely limit residents’ ability to communicate with the outside world.”

Singapore has a 10-year “certificate of entitlement” (COE) system, introduced in 1990, to control the number of vehicles in the small country, which is home to 5.9 million people and can be driven across in less than an hour.

Including COE, registration fees and taxes, a new standard Toyota Camry Hybrid currently costs $183,000 in Singapore, compared with $28,855 in the U.S. The cost of buying that Camry in Singapore is about double the price of a small, government-subsidised flat in the country.

Heightened bedbug fears permeated TikTok this week as U.S. influencers began flying home from Paris Fashion Week, which ended Tuesday. 

Bedbugs are “hitchhikers” that latch onto fabric and wood, which is often how they get into homes, according to Jossue Rivas, an exterminator. 

On average, it takes three months for people to notice they have an infestation, he said. Bedbug eggs and nymphs can be too small to initially notice.

Their small and narrow bodies enable them to squeeze into tiny spots, like the seams of a mattress or couch and the folds of curtains.

It marks a new stage in a yearslong battle by “accidental Americans” — U.S. citizens who neither live in the country nor have any real ties to it but must still pay taxes to Uncle Sam — to reduce the costs they face.

Unlike most countries, the U.S. imposes a citizenship-based taxation system, irrespective of where a person lives or works.

The $2,350 that Rachel Heller paid to renounce her citizenship years ago was almost equivalent to her monthly salary. The State Department announced Monday it would be dropping the fee back down to $450, the amount it used to charge until 2014. Heller, a Netherlands resident, wants a refund of the difference.

But as much as it may feel imperative to stay fully engaged in the tragic updates and charged conversations like those about Israel and Gaza, doing so without boundaries may lead to compassion fatigue, said Dr. Rebecca Sachs, a clinical psychologist based in New York City.

The term was created to capture the experience of people in caretaking roles or professions — such as therapists, firefighters, police officers, emergency room health care professionals and family members caring for someone with a chronic condition, said Dr. Charles Figley, Kurzweg Distinguished Chair in Disaster Mental Health at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Those who are watching traumatic things unfold in communities they are connected to as well as those they empathize with from afar may also feel the impact of compassion fatigue, Sachs said. That can lead to exhaustion, irritability and difficulty continuing to engage with their empathy if not attended to, Sachs said.

CNN,Cyy43fZJBir,2023-10-24 20:34:07,GraphImage,"Finding clean water is becoming an all-consuming – and increasingly difficult – challenge for many Gazans.

Hamas’ brutal attacks in Israel on October 7 killed at least 1,400 people and the group took more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. In the wake of the assault, Israel launched an aerial bombardment of Gaza that Palestinian health officials say has killed more than 5,000 people. Israel also announced a “complete siege” on the enclave, withholding vital supplies of water, food and fuel.

Israel has since allowed some water to flow through one of the three pipelines that run into Gaza, but experts say it covers only a tiny percentage of the enclave’s needs. Most of Gaza’s water comes from local sources – but the fuel required to pump and clean it is fast running out.

The climate crisis is also having an impact. Sea level rise will increase the salinity of the groundwater and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat and drought further threaten water resources.

But forensic analysis of publicly available imagery and footage has begun to offer some clues as to what caused the explosion.
 
CNN has reviewed dozens of videos posted on social media, aired on live broadcasts and filmed by a freelance journalist working for CNN in Gaza, as well as satellite imagery, to piece together what happened in as much detail as possible.
 
Without the ability to access the site and gather evidence from the ground, no conclusion can be definitive. But CNN’s analysis suggests that a rocket launched from within Gaza broke up midair, and that the blast at the hospital was the result of part of the rocket landing at the hospital complex.

Phone and internet service had been knocked out for days as Israel began an intensified ground operation on Friday. But phone and internet connectivity partially returned on Sunday morning, according to the chief executive of the main Palestinian telecommunications company. 

The death toll in Gaza since Oct. 7 exceeded 8,000 people, including 3,342 children, a spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday.

The video shows a projectile streaking through the darkened skies over Gaza and exploding in the air. Seconds later, another explosion is seen on the ground.

The footage has become a widely cited piece of evidence as Israeli and American officials have made the case that an errant Palestinian rocket malfunctioned in the sky, fell to the ground and caused a deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

But a detailed visual analysis by The New York Times concludes that the video clip — taken from an Al Jazeera television camera livestreaming on the night of Oct. 17 — shows something else. The projectile seen in the video is most likely not what caused the explosion at the hospital. It actually detonated in the sky roughly two miles away, The Times found, and is an unrelated aspect of the fighting that unfolded over the Israeli-Gaza border that night.

The Times’s finding does not answer what did cause the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital blast, or who is responsible. The contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch is to blame remains plausible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.

The hospital blast has become a searing, contested episode in the war that began on Oct. 7, after Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, invaded Israel, killing more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers and seizing 200 hostages who were taken back to Gaza, according to the Israeli government. Israel has responded with a relentless artillery and bombing campaign that has killed 5,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.

NYTimes,Cyvf6ZmxhV3,2023-10-23 12:58:29,GraphImage,"On Oct. 17, The New York Times published news of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City, leading its coverage with claims by Hamas government officials that an Israeli airstrike was the cause and that hundreds of people were dead or injured. The report included a large headline at the top of The Times’s website.

Israel subsequently denied being at fault and blamed an errant rocket launch by the Palestinian faction group Islamic Jihad, which has in turn denied responsibility. American and other international officials have said their evidence indicates that the rocket came from Palestinian fighter positions.

The Times’s initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage — and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels — relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.

The Times continued to update its coverage as more information became available, reporting the disputed claims of responsibility and noting that the death toll might be lower than initially reported. Within two hours, the headline and other text at the top of the website reflected the scope of the explosion and the dispute over responsibility.

Given the sensitive nature of the news during a widening conflict, and the prominent promotion it received, Times editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been more explicit about what information could be verified.

Farmers are grappling with shocks that made fertilizer scarce and unaffordable, diminishing harvests, raising food prices and spreading hunger. The war in Ukraine reduced the region’s grain exports and sent the price of staples like wheat soaring from Egypt to Indonesia. The world’s food supply is also menaced by the ravages of climate change — heat waves, drought, floods. 

The breakdown in fertilizer production challenges the orthodoxy that has dominated international trade for decades. Prominent economists have promoted globalization as insurance against upheaval. When factories in one place cannot produce goods, they can be summoned from somewhere else. Yet as farmers across Africa and parts of Asia contend with fertilizer shortages, their anguish attests to a less celebrated aspect of the interlinked economy: Shared dependence on vital products from dominant suppliers yields widespread danger when shocks emerge.

The state has sent away more than 50,000 migrants, helping to provoke a shelter crisis in several U.S. cities like Denver and Chicago that has reshaped the debate over immigration.

The program is now an organized migrant transportation system that helps alleviate the strain of new arrivals on small border cities at a cost of roughly $75 million, and that number is growing. Still, it has not succeeded in what is perhaps Abbott’s biggest goal: forcing the federal government to adopt more stringent border controls, favored by Republicans.

Now, Abbott is trying to change Texas law to make crossing the border from Mexico without authorization a state crime, allowing the police in Texas to arrest people coming across the Rio Grande, including asylum seekers. The State Senate passed the bill this month during a special legislative session, though it has yet to be approved by the Texas House.

Thirty years ago, when he moved into a Brooklyn townhouse, he planted two baby pawpaw trees. Despite growing up and down the East Coast and being North America’s largest native edible fruit, the pawpaw is undersung and difficult to source. The trees take at least three years – sometimes as long as 10 – to bear fruit. And then it has a brief season— generally limited to September— and a shelf life of only three to five days. The fruit bruises easily, making it a poor candidate for conventional grocery stores. 

In spite of these quirks — or perhaps because of them — the pawpaw enjoys a small but devoted following. Farzan has become something of an evangelist, an active member of seven pawpaw-centric groups on Facebook, where he gladly shares his wisdom with newcomers.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ordered a call-up of reservists after Palestinian militants fired thousands of rockets, invaded several Israeli towns and took hostages. Nearly 300 people have been killed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.

The Israeli military said that the militants had entered at least 22 Israeli towns and abducted soldiers and civilians, including an older grandmother. Residents of Israeli border towns told broadcasters that gunmen were moving door to door, looking for civilians. Unverified footage appeared to show Palestinian fighters transporting captured Israeli civilians and bodies through the Gaza Strip.

The timing of the assault, at one of the most difficult moments in Israel’s history, was striking. It followed months of profound anxiety in Israel about the cohesion of its society and the readiness of its military, a crisis set off by the government’s efforts to reduce the power of the judiciary. And the violence came 50 years and a day after the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Israel was also surprised by a complex Arab attack, leading to huge Israeli losses and soul-searching about the state of the country.

By early evening, the Israeli military said fighting continued in at least five places in southern Israel, around 70 Israelis had been reported dead by emergency medical groups, and Israel had retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities. At least 198 Palestinians were killed in either gun battles or airstrikes, the Gazan Health Ministry said.

The Hamas militants behind the attack also took Israelis hostage, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said. 

In an assault without recent precedent in its complexity and scale, the militants crossed into Israel by land, sea and air, according to the Israeli military, leading to some of the first pitched battles between large groups of Israeli and Arab forces on Israeli soil in decades. As of early evening there were the two main battles taking place, near the towns of Ofakim and Beeri, Admiral Hagai said.

All told, the Israeli military said that the militants had entered at least 22 Israeli towns, abducting soldiers and civilians, including an older grandmother.

No such difference exists at most flagship public colleges, where in-state students from across the income spectrum attend at roughly similar rates.

The data comes from an expansive new research project on college admissions. It combines college attendance records with federal income tax data to show the share of all college-bound students who attend a given college by parental income. And it shows the chances that similarly qualified students — those with the same standardized test scores — have at attending a college based on their parents’ income.

The center, which turned 50 this year, is singular among the state’s 52 state parks in that its draw is not landscape and nature. 

“Our resource here is the people,” said Keith Symanowitz, the park’s promotions director. “Our mission here is to perpetuate, present and promote the Ozark way of life.” The staff does so by giving the people of the region, which is rural and largely white, a place to do the things they’ve always done — and visitors can watch and even try those things themselves: making quilts, brooms, knives and home remedies; carving wood, forging iron, tanning and shaping leather; weaving and dyeing fabric.

Though Mountain View’s economy depends to a large extent on tourism, the place is authentic. People there are living their lives as they always have, not because they think you will find it enchanting, but because that is what they do and they like doing it.

Butler has been a fixture in California politics for nearly 15 years as a former leader of the state’s largest labor union and an adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2021, she became the first Black woman to take the helm at Emily’s List, the fund-raising powerhouse dedicated to electing female candidates and supporters of reproductive rights. Senator Feinstein died at 90 on Thursday. 

In choosing Butler, who is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday, Newsom followed through on a pledge he made more than two years ago to name a Black woman to the Senate if a vacancy were to emerge.

This year, Paltrow was roundly mocked online for a filmed interview in which she talked about intermittent fasting and her seemingly stringent diet. In March, spectators took note of every outfit she wore (mostly from Goop’s G Label) in her trial for a 2016 skiing collision in Utah. Her 2014 post on her divorce from the Coldplay singer Chris Martin delivered the phrase “conscious uncoupling” to the world.

Goop, which encompasses a whole constellation of healthy-ish, wellness-flavored brands, is celebrating its 15th anniversary. It’s derided by critics (in September 2018 Goop settled a false-advertising lawsuit brought by district attorneys in California) as much as it’s adored by fans. As an entrepreneur, Paltrow may wield more power than she ever did when she was regularly acting.

Investigators said that Law had shipped 160 packages in Canada; he has been charged by multiple police agencies in Ontario with counseling or aiding suicide in connection with the 14 deaths. The victims were between 16 and 36 years old.

Britain is investigating the deaths of 88 of the 272 people there who purchased salts from Law’s website, a spokesman for the National Crime Agency in Britain said in an email.

Will the prospective buildings impose a weight limit, as they often do? Will Great Danes be on a list of forbidden breeds, as they frequently are? Will the management charge a monthly pet rent that can be as high as $100? Will it insist on meeting your dog, and if so, will there be chemistry?

Canine owners and experts agree that it is not the size of the dog that matters in city apartments, but the animal’s disposition and needs. 

But building rules aside, what’s it actually like sharing a small apartment with a large canine roommate? And what breeds might make better apartment dogs than others?

⁠
But Julia says the owner told them it was haunted informally and jokingly, saying things like, “Of course it’s haunted; it’s an old house.” Then, the owner died on the day she was moving out of the home.⁠

As soon as the couple moved in, Julia says coins started showing up. Shiny pennies turned up for several years where she had already scoured. “It was like she came back every night and seeded the ground with pennies,” Julia says. “It was weird. She didn’t want to leave…and by God, she didn’t.”⁠
⁠
The rules surrounding disclosure in the sale of a supposedly haunted house have a few surprises. In Massachusetts, New Jersey and Minnesota, a supposed haunting is explicitly listed in disclosure rules as a non-material fact that does not need to be disclosed to potential buyers. New York is the fourth state that overtly addresses hauntings. In all states, neither seller nor agent can misrepresent the home’s history if they are asked.⁠
⁠
According to data compiled by All Star Home, only 24% of those surveyed say they would buy a haunted house.⁠
⁠
Florida real-estate agent Wes Pearce doesn’t believe in ghosts and thinks the current rules about disclosure are fine. “These claims are impossible to prove,” he says, “and such subjective claims could unfairly tarnish perfectly good properties.”⁠

WSJ,CzCVU6nunBf,2023-10-30 20:31:25,GraphImage,"“Friends” was the sitcom that defined us, and Matthew Perry’s Chandler Bing was its defining character, writes Kyle Smith, the Journal’s film critic, for @wsjopinion.

Chandler was nearly Perry’s double: a tortured loner for whom cynicism was body armor. He died prematurely on Saturday, at 54.

Flip, sarcastic and allergic to attachment, Perry typified the Gen X sensibility in his 10 years as Chandler. Our age cohort (I was born in 1966, Perry three years later) has frequently been dismissed as nondescript, but what is special about us has become apparent in retrospect. We were the last generation to grow up predigital, meaning spoken conversation was our default means of communication. We were scarred by divorce, which peaked when we were kids, like no generation before or since. Many of us sought to build replacement families out of pals living close at hand, taking dorm living as our model.

Perry’s portrayal of Chandler was informed by revealing conversations he had with the show’s writers. Unlike Matt LeBlanc’s Joey Tribbiani (a caricature of a brainless actor) and David Schwimmer’s Ross Geller (painfully earnest and therefore not typical of a generation that venerates irony), Chandler was the perpetual wry observer, wisecracking from a distance.

His cynicism and sarcasm were a reflection of our own outlook on life.

Anxious consumers have turned to weed and edibles for relief as treatments for their ailments have become harder to find. The number of available and affordable therapists badly lags demand and traditional medications don’t work for everyone.⁠
⁠
Driving both users’ and businesses’ hopes is a belief that pot can make us less anxious. Yet little independent scientific evidence shows that cannabis is an effective treatment for anxiety problems, and some studies have found it can worsen symptoms. Researchers say this is particularly true for products high in THC, the substance responsible for marijuana’s intoxicating effects.⁠
⁠
Cannabis use was significantly associated with increased odds of developing anxiety conditions, according to a review of research published in 2020 in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Recent cannabis use was associated with more severe symptoms in people with anxiety and mood disorders, according to another review published in 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. ⁠
⁠
In some surveys, cannabis users have reported that they have felt relief from anxiety symptoms after consuming cannabis. ⁠
⁠
A survey last year found that nearly two-thirds of people said they would prefer to use cannabis rather than pharmaceuticals to treat a medical issue, according to the survey conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of cannabis company Curaleaf of almost 2,000 adults who were at least 21 years old. And among the 54% of respondents who said they had ever used cannabis, 41% of them said they consumed cannabis to reduce anxiety.⁠

⁠
The number of Anchorage residents without homes grew nearly 60% between 2019 and 2023 to an estimated 1,760. That is more than bigger cities including Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.; Baltimore, and Oklahoma City, based on point-in-time counts conducted once each year.⁠
⁠
Allowing people to stay on the streets means likely injury or death in a city that experiences an average of 20 days annually below zero degrees Fahrenheit. But an arena used to house those without homes the past three winters was recently closed, and political infighting killed plans to build a large new shelter. ⁠
⁠
Now, as part of a plan approved just a month before bitterly cold temperatures typically arrive in mid-November, aid workers are scrambling to get an estimated 700 people living outdoors into a network of hotel rooms and other makeshift facilities. Some are being offered one-way tickets to the Lower 48 states.⁠
⁠
Cold weather is a growing public-health threat as more people live on the streets nationwide. Nationally, about 700 homeless people a year die from exposure to the cold, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit group. In Anchorage, a record 43 people have died from cold and other causes outdoors so far this year, compared with six in all of 2019.⁠
⁠
This city of 288,000 is home to 40% of Alaska’s population of 730,000, but nearly 70% of the homeless population in this year’s point-in-time count. Across the U.S., such one-time tallies are widely acknowledged to undercount the total number of homeless people in an area.⁠

⁠
For staff, that means reversing overdoses in bathrooms, confronting patrons watching pornography or defending against people brandishing guns. Some people come to the library to sleep, get warm or use the bathroom. Others are looking for jobs, housing or just somewhere safe to read.⁠
⁠
Librarians are helping more patrons in crisis, and many cities are hiring social workers to help them. About two-thirds of nearly 600 library workers surveyed by Urban Librarians Unite in 2022 said they had experienced violent or aggressive behavior from patrons.⁠
⁠
Six years ago, fewer than two dozen libraries in North America employed full-time social workers, said Sarah Johnson, a licensed social worker and adjunct lecturer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Today, more than 100 employ social workers, and more have social-work interns, she said.⁠

Now, many cities riddled with half-empty office buildings are hoping to survive the new remote-work era without bulldozing swaths of downtown and starting from scratch.⁠
⁠
American downtowns instead face the biggest urban makeover in 50 years, experts say. It's a turning point similar to when factories disappeared from city centers during the 20th century’s workplace transformation and left steel-and-glass office towers as the primary economic engines.⁠
⁠
Even optimists estimate it will take years and cost billions to complete the large-scale changes to usher central-city office districts into a new role—busy neighborhoods where people live, work, raise families and find entertainment.⁠
⁠
Some cities have been pushing to remake their downtown districts for years and know the many obstacles: Few office buildings can be converted to housing. Downtowns don’t easily accommodate family life. Crime fears keep people in the suburbs. No one wants to be downtown if nobody else is.⁠
⁠
Minneapolis, which has seen lonely sidewalks and empty storefronts in its downtown, is considering a pedestrian-only zone and has offered tax breaks to convert offices to apartments. But office building renovations are tough even under the best conditions. Demolitions are costly, developers often have to buy out office leaseholders, and interest rates are high.⁠
⁠
“We’re going to have to work on creating spaces down there that are appealing to people on weekends,” said George Sherman, a longtime Minneapolis developer who is trying to convert downtown offices to apartments. “Right now, that’s hard to imagine.

⁠
But it also matters where they begin on the political spectrum, and there are indications that millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z started out more liberal than prior generations. That has made them a crucial base of support for Democrats, even as some other groups of voters have moved away from the party.⁠
⁠
Gaining assets and income pushes voters toward conservative fiscal policies, such as lower taxes, that allow them to keep more of their money, researchers say. As Americans move from midlife to retirement, they are more likely to favor stability over change, and less likely to back liberal policies that upset the social order.⁠
⁠
This rightward shift is likely to affect who wins elections in 2024 and the years beyond. One in six Americans is age 65 or over, up from one in eight a decade prior, according to the most recent decennial census. A slump in births that started in 2008 will eventually give way to a smaller pool of new, young voters.⁠

⁠
Data released Tuesday shows the number of abortions ticked up slightly in the year following the high court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. That ruling, from June 2022, ended federal protections for the procedure, and paved the way for some 16 states to ban many or most abortions. ⁠
⁠
The data indicate that abortion providers, funders and others have adapted quickly to a legal landscape that has changed profoundly. Access has been cut off throughout much of the South, and demand has surged in states in which abortion is still legal. Many providers there have had to significantly increase capacity. ⁠
⁠
In the new study, WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, found that nationwide there were 183 more monthly abortions on average in the 12-month period following the Dobbs decision compared with the monthly average prior to the decision. ⁠
⁠
While it has become much harder since the end of Roe to obtain an abortion in states with newly enacted bans, it actually appears to have become easier in many other states, thanks to increased attention and resources. Abortion funds, nonprofits that help finance abortions and logistics associated with them, have raised millions to help lower-income women pay for procedures and travel, while new clinics have opened in states such as Illinois and New Mexico that have become major destinations for women traveling from other states. ⁠
⁠
Nearly 115,000 fewer abortions were performed in the year after the Dobbs decision in states that banned abortions throughout pregnancy or after six weeks, according to the WeCount data. At the same time, states including Illinois, Florida and North Carolina—where the procedure remained largely legal—saw an increase of 117,000 abortions. ⁠

⁠
Ghanaian refugee John Ekow boarded a vessel in July in the Ivory Coast with the prospect of making landfall in the U.S. There was just one problem: the ship was bound for Brazil.⁠
⁠
Brazilian officials have been bedeviled by a new phenomenon: a small but growing number of African migrants who completed a perilous 2,000-mile journey from West Africa after sneaking onto cargo ships they believed were actually headed for Europe or the U.S.⁠
⁠
Some African arrivals say criminal gangs and fishermen in West Africa tricked them into boarding the wrong ships, charging a small fee to hoist them aboard, including onto narrow platforms behind the ship’s rudder, according to researchers and authorities studying clandestine immigration. ⁠
⁠
“I was gutted,” Ekow said, describing the moment the ship’s captain told him he was not in the U.S. but in Macapá, Brazil, where the Atlantic meets the Amazon River.⁠
⁠
The 24-year-old and a friend boarded the ship in Abidjan with the help of a local fisherman. During the trip the men huddled together for warmth, rationing out tins of sardines and a bottled mush of cassava flour and water. By the third day, the food was gone. By the fifth, they ran out of water.⁠
⁠
On the seventh day, the ship suddenly slowed down. Police officers at the port of Macapá said they could either go back to Africa or stay in Brazil and file for asylum, Ekow said. Both opted for the latter. His friend, who had brought a fistful of dollars with him, told Ekow he was going to try and trudge to the U.S.⁠
⁠
A total of 234 migrants arrived in Brazil as stowaways between 2006 and 2017, almost exclusively from Africa, hidden in ships that docked in at least 15 different states along Brazil’s almost 5,000-mile coastline, according to the latest available data from the country’s navy. ⁠

WSJ,Cywky2avUa7,2023-10-23 23:00:23,GraphImage,"With the Capitol in chaos and the speaker’s position going on its third week of vacancy, Rep. Matt Gaetz surveyed the consequences of his actions and declared he had no regrets.⁠
⁠
“I have extreme confidence,” the Florida Republican said in an interview from his Capitol Hill office, “that we will have an upgrade at the position.”⁠
⁠
The House has had no speaker since Gaetz made a motion to vacate the position, then joined on Oct. 3 with seven other Republicans and 208 Democrats to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) from the role. Rep. Jim Jordan, the archconservative Ohio Republican whom Gaetz calls a mentor, this week failed on three ballots to secure the majority of the body’s votes, losing support on each roll call and then bowing out of the race Friday afternoon. No one else seems to have a clear path to 217 GOP votes for the position. ⁠
⁠
Many of his colleagues blame Gaetz for the paralysis and acrimony that have ensued. When Gaetz rose to speak in a closed-door party meeting on Thursday, McCarthy told him to “sit your ass down,” and another Republican, Rep. Mike Bost of Illinois, cursed and lunged at Gaetz.⁠
⁠
Asked about the encounter afterward, McCarthy told reporters, “Listen, the whole country, I think, would scream at Matt Gaetz right now.”⁠
⁠
The upheavals that have racked the House GOP since January are less a reflection of any coherent faction than one man’s singular will. It was Gaetz who took it upon himself to block McCarthy from the speakership in January, joining with 19 others to deny him a majority until he agreed to crippling concessions. One of those was the ability for a single member to bring the motion to vacate, which Gaetz then deployed to remove McCarthy this month.⁠
⁠
While critics accuse Gaetz of attention-mongering, he insists he is about outcomes, not headlines. He says he has received a flood of approving feedback from conservatives across the country.⁠

⁠
The poll found Americans drawing a sharp distinction between Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and is committed to the destruction of Israel, and the Palestinian people who live in Gaza and the West Bank. But it also found increased support for Israel, compared with prior surveys, in its decadeslong conflicts with Palestinians.⁠
⁠
Some 42% in the survey said the U.S. should side with Israel, a record high dating to 2002, while 3% said the U.S. should take the Palestinians’ side. The share with favorable views of both the Israeli people and their government is higher in the new survey than in similar polls in recent years, though young people are much less supportive of the longtime U.S. ally than are older Americans.⁠
⁠
At the same time, the survey found Americans reluctant to become engaged in the region. Some 52% said the U.S. shouldn’t back either Israel or the Palestinians in their long-running conflict. Just over half of Americans said the U.S. has a responsibility to support Israel in its war with Hamas.⁠

⁠
Research is making clearer the role that genes play in living to very old age. Habits like getting enough sleep, exercising and eating a healthy diet can help you stave off disease and live longer, yet when it comes to living beyond 90, genetics start to play a trump card, say researchers who study aging.⁠
⁠
About 25% of your ability to live to 90 is determined by genetics, says Dr. Thomas Perls, a professor of medicine at Boston University who leads the New England Centenarian Study. By age 100, it’s roughly 50% genetic, he estimates, and by around 106, it’s 75%.⁠
⁠
Centenarians make up a growing share of the U.S. population. There are about 109,000 centenarians living in the country in 2023, according to Census Bureau projections, up from about 65,000 10 years ago, thanks in part to decades of advances in medicine and public health.⁠
⁠
Knowing what enables some people to live very long lives has consequences for the rest of us. Ongoing research into very old age may help provide insight that could eventually be used to develop drugs or identify lifestyle changes to help people live healthier for longer, says Dr. James Kirkland, president of the American Federation for Aging Research.⁠
⁠
Perls estimates that roughly 20% of the population has the genetic makeup that could get them to 100 if they also make consistent healthy choices.⁠

Blame supply-chain shortages and the shock of empty grocery shelves during the pandemic, or more recent natural disasters and tense global events.⁠

Those business owners and survival-training coaches say they are seeing a new kind of customer looking to make sure they can get through a few days or weeks without power or fresh water in the event of a flood, fire or other calamity. These customers don’t fit the stereotype of so-called doomsday preppers stocking bunkers with ammunition and gas masks to survive an apocalypse.⁠

⁠
Connelly had quietly started amassing materials from the agency’s 160-plus-year history to revive a museum that had closed more than a century ago. ⁠
⁠
Its new location: Connelly’s office and that of his remotely working boss. His supervisor said he didn’t mind having his former desk occupied by an exhibit on botanical explorers, among others, earlier this year.⁠
⁠
Around seven months ago, Connelly, shown here, hung a sign in the hallway proclaiming “Museum” in antique-looking font, inviting passersby to stop by his warren of rooms crammed with artifacts, photos, typed placards explaining the historical significance, framed newspaper articles and colorful prints covering every inch of available wall and desktop.⁠
⁠
At the time it was built in the 1930s, the USDA’s South Building was believed to be the largest office building in the world, with 4,500 rooms, 7 miles of corridors, 12 million bricks and 11,000 miles of structural steel, according to the General Services Administration. ⁠
⁠
Connelly, a 35-year veteran of the agency, wasn’t always combing through that labyrinth looking for historical finds. But during the pandemic, he returned to the office earlier than many others and began walking the empty halls. ⁠
⁠
He began doing more research into the history of the agency, founded in 1862 by then-President Abraham Lincoln to deepen agricultural research and disseminate information at a time when about half of all Americans lived on farms. ⁠
⁠
For roughly two years, Connelly has been on a mission to track down every interesting historical item still lurking in the thousands of rooms that make up the U.S. Agriculture Department. ⁠
⁠
The museum’s latest challenge is access. For now, visitors can only enter with a USDA employee, given the location.⁠

⁠
The Journal found hundreds of merchants offering the new drug, which is being developed by Eli Lilly and is called retatrutide. Most appear to be Chinese sellers shipping directly to U.S. consumers from sites such as Made-in-China.com. Some of the sites, including ones that appear to be based in the U.S., have marketed their products via posts on Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit. A handful have run paid ads on Instagram and Google. A fitness influencer has offered it for sale via his newsletter.⁠
⁠
Excitement over retatrutide jumped in June when Lilly reported Phase 2 trial results that showed the drug led to an average weight loss of up to 24% over 48 weeks. That could prove better than Lilly’s already-approved drug Mounjaro.⁠
⁠
In August, the Journal reported that more than 50 websites were selling knockoff semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in Ozempic and Mounjaro respectively. The Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to two websites for “unlawful sale of unapproved and misbranded drugs” after the Journal’s article. One, GorillaHealing.com, no longer lists those two drugs on its website, but does offer retatrutide. Last week, three days after the warning letter was posted publicly, the top result in a Google search for “buy retatrutide” was a GorillaHealing.com ad.⁠
⁠
GorillaHealing.com didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as Google, LinkedIn and Reddit all said in statements that they removed advertisements or user posts that were flagged by the Journal, each citing internal policies.⁠

Sales of previously owned homes in 2023 are expected to dwindle to a rate not seen since at least 2011, when the U.S. population was smaller and the country was still recovering from one of the worst housing crises ever, according to many economist forecasts.⁠
⁠
Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real-estate brokerage Redfin, estimated that total existing-home sales in 2023 would amount to around 4.1 million, which would mark the smallest number of sales since about 2008, the year that Lehman Brothers collapsed and sparked the global financial crisis. Zhao said sales are unlikely to pick up much next year, with mortgage rates likely to remain at elevated levels. ⁠

This year’s housing slowdown is very different from the previous one, after the housing bubble of the early 2000s burst. Back then, the economy entered a deep recession and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure. ⁠

This time around, home sales have been slowing for more than a year because of rising borrowing costs, record-high home prices and a very limited inventory of homes for sale. ⁠

Biden later told reporters that he made his statement based on “the data I was shown by my defense department.” The Pentagon referred questions to the White House.⁠

The directive from the most powerful faction within the criminal group aims to evade pressure from U.S. law enforcement, operatives say, though some U.S. officials are skeptical that the ban will endure.⁠

The documents from Remington Arms—which was part of a firearms conglomerate called Freedom Group—are being disclosed by a lawyer who obtained them in a lawsuit filed by parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Last year they settled with Remington, which made the AR-15 used by the killer, for $73 million. ⁠
⁠
Digital replicas of real guns have appeared in numerous videogames, and executives from both industries have acknowledged they signed partnerships for that purpose. But they haven’t disclosed the details of such deals or discussed the motivations behind them.⁠
⁠
The documents, from the late 2000s and early 2010s, show Remington and Freedom Group officials pursued deals to place their guns in shooter videogames as part of a marketing push for new audiences because they were concerned their customer base was aging.⁠
⁠
Executives at the gun giant, which was owned by private-equity company Cerberus and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, believed such deals would “help create brand preference among the next generation,” and allow the company to “win our fair-share of these young consumers,” according to an undated Freedom Group memo titled “Gaming Strategy.”⁠

The records show Remington signed a deal in 2009 with videogame publisher Activision Blizzard to put a new weapon called the Adaptive Combat Rifle, or ACR, in its 2009 release “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.” Remington hoped to sell civilian and military versions of the ACR, a modular rifle that uses design elements from several other weapons including the AR-15. ⁠

“We introduced the shame for people for whom diet and exercise wasn’t enough,” she said at a recent event, seated next to the company’s investor, board director and the most famous dieter in America, Oprah Winfrey.⁠

Gradually you discover millions of people across the U.S. are in the same situation–one that will bring months or years of rebuilding. A gigantic solar storm has hit Earth. ⁠
⁠
The odds are low that in any given year a storm big enough to cause effects this widespread will happen. And the severity of those impacts will depend on many factors, including the state of our planet’s magnetic field on that day. But it’s a near certainty that some form of this catastrophe will happen someday, says Ian Cohen, a chief scientist who studies heliophysics at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.⁠
⁠
To get ahead of this threat, a loose federation of U.S. and international government agencies, and hundreds of scientists affiliated with those bodies, have begun working on how to make predictions about what our Sun might do. And a small but growing cadre of scientists argue that artificial intelligence will be an essential component of efforts to give us advance notice of such a storm.⁠
⁠
The most dangerous of these solar storms is known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME, when a gargantuan blob of charged particles is catapulted from the Sun’s atmosphere by rapidly shifting magnetic fields, at speeds in excess of 8,000 times that of sound. These happen often, but we’re rarely aware of them because they only affect us when they happen to strike earth.⁠
⁠
Satellites that orbit high above Earth in so-called geostationary orbit would be the first to feel the effects. In theory, they can be incapacitated by “killer electrons” more common during certain kinds of solar storms. The electrons can penetrate satellites, and the resulting charge can build up, damaging electronics. Losing these satellites could cause worldwide disruption of GPS services.⁠

WSJ,CyY3VaBMo9U,2023-10-14 18:00:31,GraphSidecar,"After a historic run-up in prices, the luxury rental market in the Miami area is seeing a significant slowdown. ⁠
⁠
Although rents are still generally higher than they were prepandemic, local real-estate agents said the velocity of people moving to Miami has slowed and there are fewer people willing to overpay. Meanwhile, newly built apartments are adding thousands of rental units to the market, further easing the supply-demand imbalance that has characterized the market over the past few years.⁠
⁠
In the Miami luxury market, defined as the top 10% of the market, nearly all segments are down from pandemic-era peaks, said local real-estate agent Ana Bozovic, whose firm Analytics.Miami tracks the market. ⁠
⁠
So far this year, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom house in Miami-Dade County is $8,500, down 15% from $10,000 last year, she said. For condos, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom is $8,200, down 8.9% from $9,000 last year.⁠
⁠
Overall, Miami’s rental market seems to be cooling faster than other cities nationwide, according to data from listing website Zumper. In September, the median monthly rent for a Miami one-bedroom apartment fell 1.47% to $2,690 from the month before, and 1.96% to $2,500 in Miami Beach, Zumper said. By comparison, the median rent for a one-bedroom nationwide grew 0.1% to $1,511 during the same period.⁠
⁠
The dip is a sharp change from the frenzied pace of the real-estate market over the past few years, as an influx of people moved to Miami for warm weather and low taxes, driving up real-estate values to historic levels. ⁠

With the unemployment rate hovering near a half-century low, the tight labor market means employers are in a delicate dance with workers over the optimal amount of work-from-home flexibility.⁠
⁠
Studies show that workers value the freedom and flexibility of remote work, in some cases more than a pay raise.⁠

The top offense for dogs, according to a survey of 1,000 pet owners commissioned by Amazon-owned Ring in April, is getting into the garbage. For cats, it’s scratching furniture.⁠
⁠
Owners can use the two-way audio on these types of cameras to stop their pets’ misbehavior. The cameras have smartphone apps that let people check in from the office or the other side of the globe. Two-thirds of dog and cat owners say they’ve been able to successfully intervene, according to the Ring survey.⁠

The dog stops barking immediately when she hears her owner’s voice. ⁠

Hamas fighters on the ground explicitly targeted Israeli civilians for killing. Israelis were shot while driving along the street. They were pulled from their homes and killed. Hamas carried out the mass murder of some 260 people at the Tribe of Nova music festival.

Vladimir Putin, a purported friend of Israel, has said little, other than blaming a failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East. No surprise there. What Hamas did to the Israelis is what Putin has been doing to civilians in Ukraine for almost two years.

Since the February 2022 invasion, it is estimated that about 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. Russia has killed hundreds with missiles fired into residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns. It has targeted schools, hospitals and food markets.

These civilian deaths—by Hamas in Israel and Russia in Ukraine—are not collateral damage from urban warfare. They are part of the war plan, thought out by calm men sitting around a table, in Moscow or Beirut, looking at maps and civilian targets. Crimes against humanity are becoming normalized.

Our adversaries—Russia, Iran, China and North Korea—will continue the mass killing of civilians and hostage-taking as a strategic policy until the U.S. decisively counters this awful new normal.

⁠
Houston, Dallas and Austin top the list of major U.S. cities with the highest office-vacancy rates, according to Moody’s Analytics. About 25% of their office space wasn’t leased as of the third quarter. That was more than double New York’s vacancy rate of 12% and well above San Francisco’s vacancy rate of 17%.⁠
⁠
Texas office floors are struggling to find tenants even though the state’s workers have been more eager to get back to the office than in most other places. According to Kastle Systems, which measures occupancy by counting keycard swipes in 10 major metro areas, Houston, Austin and Dallas have the highest office-return rates.⁠
⁠
Vacancies are high largely because Texas developers build too much. All three cities experienced a surge in construction in the 1980s, when tax rules favored developers and loose lending created a commercial real-estate bubble. Another construction spurt in the late 1990s aggravated the problem.⁠
⁠
Texas’ high vacancy rate offers more evidence that the U.S. office market’s biggest problem hasn’t been primarily remote work. It is a glut of buildings across the U.S., which has been decades in the making and helps explain why the country has long had much higher vacancy rates than Europe or Asia. Office markets in other booming Sunbelt cities such as Atlanta are also suffering, despite economic growth and job creation.⁠

The younger Arnault is learning the ropes of his father’s luxury’s empire, and Louis Vuitton has bet on the 24-year-old to turn the brand into a player in high-end, mechanical watchmaking.⁠
⁠
Jean was standing in a gilded, mirrored room of Paris’s Musée d’Orsay showing off Louis Vuitton’s newest watch model to a clutch of experts one July morning. The thin unisex watch, named the Tambour, was the result of almost two years of work. But the most valuable Tambour in the building wasn’t on display with the others. It was on Arnault’s wrist.⁠
⁠
His version was made of the rare metal tantalum. Tantalum gave the watch its gunmetal color, though the metal’s hardness also meant that the watch took twice as much time to manufacture. This made it “insanely expensive” when he bought it, Arnault said, though he refused to reveal what he paid.⁠
⁠
“We’re only going to make one,” Arnault said. “That’s it. It’s the only one.”⁠
⁠
Two years ago, when he first joined Louis Vuitton’s watches division as market ing and development director, Louis Vuitton watches ran a wide gamut. They ranged from watches costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to quartz timepieces that sold for around $4,000.⁠
⁠
Now Arnault has decided to eliminate the entry-level Tambours. His thinking was that instead of producing more affordable collections, Louis Vuitton needed to play in a different class. So the new iteration of the timepiece ranges in price from $18,500 to $52,000, putting it in competition with similar creations from the likes of Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin.⁠
⁠
“We’re not going to make a ton of money with this,” Arnault says of the company’s strategic about-face. “It’s not going to be highly profitable at all, but it’s really about making sure that we switch the message completely.”⁠

Scientists who study nutrition and health say that people who lose weight on international travels are likely benefiting from two things: more daily steps while on vacation and, yes, food that is often healthier and less processed.⁠
⁠
Ultra-processed foods common in the U.S. include artificial additives and highly refined ingredients and are rich in starch, sugar and salt, says Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of nutrition and medicine at Tufts University. He points to a study in the European Journal of Nutrition that found that among adults in the U.S., 57% of calories come from ultra-processed food, compared with 12% in Europe.⁠
⁠
What’s more, portion sizes tend to be larger in the U.S., and people drink more sodas and sugar-sweetened beverages, food researchers say. And Europeans often eat in a more leisurely way that is less prone to overeating, they note.⁠

WSJ,CyCOffoNhFl,2023-10-05 23:00:29,GraphImage,"The University of Pennsylvania is basking in the glow of two researchers who this week were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering work on messenger RNA.⁠
⁠
Until recently, the school and its faculty largely disdained one of those scientists.⁠
⁠
Penn demoted Katalin Karikó, shunting her to a lab on the outskirts of campus while cutting her pay. Karikó’s colleagues denigrated her mRNA research and some wouldn’t work with her, according to her and people at the school. Eventually, Karikó persuaded another Penn researcher, Drew Weissman, to work with her on modifying mRNA for vaccines and drugs, though most others at the school remained skeptical, pushing other approaches. ⁠
⁠
Karikó hasn’t only proven her detractors wrong but also reached the pinnacle of science. Her research with Weissman helped lead to the mRNA vaccines that protected people worldwide during the Covid-19 pandemic and now shows promise for flu, cancer and other diseases.⁠
⁠
Penn, which patented their mRNA technology, has made millions of dollars from drugmakers that licensed it. And on Monday, when Karikó and Weissman were awarded the Nobel, the school expressed a different perspective on their work.⁠
⁠
The reversal offers a glimpse of the clubby, hothouse world of academia and science, where winning financial funding is a constant burden, securing publication is a frustrating challenge and those with unconventional or ambitious approaches can struggle to gain support and acceptance.⁠

⁠
Bobbi de Winter had found her retirement paradise on Ecuador’s coast, where tiny red crabs scuttle across pristine beaches, giant sea turtles lay their eggs and whales breach the warm Pacific waters.⁠
⁠
De Winter, a native of Atlanta, and her husband, Andre, had recently finished building a house overlooking the Pacific, accessible by crossing a lush forest. They set up hammocks, planted banana and papaya trees, and hosted dinner parties as the sun set over the ocean. ⁠
⁠
Then came the drug gangs and horrific violence. Killings marred the once-sleepy district where they live, De Winter said, recalling how her husband once had to swerve his car to avoid a man who’d been shot in the street. A month after the De Winters finished their house, police found millions of dollars in cocaine stashed at a nearby beach, drugs that officers said were to be trafficked north on high-powered boats. A presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, was gunned down in August. ⁠
⁠
Worried about Ecuador’s deteriorating security, the De Winters now intend to sell. “I had to let go of my dream,” said De Winter. ⁠
⁠
This year, Ecuador is on track to top 7,000 killings, seven times the number in 2018, government data shows.⁠
⁠
Driving the carnage is the country’s transformation into a transshipment hub for drugs from neighboring Colombia, where cocaine production hit a record high. The disarmament of Colombian drug-trafficking guerrillas in 2016 led to a power vacuum as other gangs battled to take over the routes into Ecuador, with its hundreds of miles of unguarded coast. ⁠

⁠
Interest rates are up. Inflation remains high. Pandemic savings have shrunk. And the labor market is cooling.⁠
⁠
Yet household spending, the primary driver of the nation’s economic growth, remains robust. Americans spent 5.8% more in August than a year earlier, well outstripping less than 4% inflation. And the experience economy boomed this summer, with Delta Air Lines reporting record revenue in the second quarter and Ticketmaster selling over 295 million event tickets in the first six months of 2023, up nearly 18% year-over-year.⁠
⁠
Economists and financial advisers say consumers putting short-term needs and goals above long-term ones is normal. Still, this moment is different, they say.⁠
⁠
A tough housing market has more consumers writing off something they’d historically save for, while the pandemic showed the instability of any long-term plans related to health, work or day-to-day life. So, they are spending on once-in-a-lifetime experiences because they worry they may not be able to do them later.⁠
⁠
“It’s not a regret-filled, spur-of-the-moment decision,” says Michael Liersch, who oversees a team of advisers as head of advice at Wells Fargo. “It’s the opposite of that, where I would regret not having done it.”⁠
⁠
Consumers might not be able to keep splurging forever. Labor strikes and student loan repayments could both lead people to pull back. Rising gas prices could also deter travel.⁠

⁠
Made from rigid plastic foam, plumbing and scrap equipment, the gear is produced based on the logic that every Russian missile, shell or drone used to strike them is one fewer targeting real equipment and troops. ⁠
⁠
Replicas likely account for at least some of the weapons Russia claims to have destroyed on the battlefield, which exceed the numbers in Ukraine’s arsenal.⁠
⁠
Decoys can help mislead an enemy about attack plans or fool an opponent into believing that an area is better defended than it really is, deterring an assault. Deception has been an important tool of warfare throughout history, but the war in Ukraine has presented new challenges. Advances in thermal imaging can reveal targets that are invisible to the naked eye, or expose fakes as inert dummies. Inexpensive drones offer armies pervasive real-time surveillance, which complicates longstanding approaches to assembling or inflating replicas.⁠
⁠
Combatants say that with everything on a battlefield potentially observed, deception becomes more difficult—and more critical.⁠

⁠
Many emergency doctors don’t treat enough children to be able to spot life-threatening illnesses obscured by run-of-the-mill symptoms, or conditions more common in kids. Some E.R. staff default to drug doses and protocols meant for adults and either don’t have or don’t know where to find child-size gear in a crisis.⁠

Matthew Melancon, pictured here on the left, and Avery Guzman-Mendez, on the right, died 20 years apart after being treated at the same emergency room in Texas that was unable to successfully intubate them. The hospital, Ascension Seton Highland Lakes, hasn’t been certified under a Texas program that recognizes facilities working to upgrade their crisis care for kids.⁠
⁠
Avery’s family settled a lawsuit against the hospital earlier this year. Terms weren’t disclosed. Ascension, the health system that owns Highland Lakes, didn’t respond to requests for comment, but in court records issued a blanket denial of all the lawsuit’s allegations.⁠

Telling the truth can spark change, make your work life better and show off your own assertiveness. Or you could get fired. (At least it feels that way.)⁠
⁠
Like it or not, silence isn’t an option. But you have to be really careful about just how candid to get with the boss.⁠
⁠
The average person lies three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting someone new, according to research from Robert Feldman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Such superficial fibs lubricate many of our social interactions, he says, helping us fit in and getting people to like us. ⁠
⁠
“At the end of the day, we want to hear good things,” Feldman says. “Your boss is just like everybody else.""⁠

What about when bosses want to be tapped into what’s really going on, too? After all, you’re the one who’s connected to collegial chatter and gossip, which can give managers insight into how they can do a better job and get ahead. Giving the right information to your boss can help you, too. You just have to share it the right way.⁠
⁠
A smart start is to ask some questions of your own to the boss, says Matt Abrahams, who teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. What kind of guidance do they typically find useful? If they readily divulge a time they messed up or made a change, be more candid, he suggests.⁠

⁠
Vacancy rates are soaring and companies are competing to unload space in the sublease market. Office values and rents are falling. Developers are delaying new office projects, while office defaults are mounting.⁠
⁠
Atlanta’s commercial-property turmoil shows that even Sunbelt cities with thriving economies can’t escape the office-sector meltdown. Strong job growth hasn’t made up for the city’s anemic return-to-office rate, a glut of new office supply in the years leading up to the pandemic and companies shedding space as leases expire. ��⁠

Atlanta’s office-vacancy rate has increased to 14.7% from 11.5% at the end of 2019, according to CoStar. That is well below the 20% vacancy rate in San Francisco. But CoStar is projecting that forces such as additional company downsizing will push Atlanta office vacancies above the city’s record 16% level it hit during the 2008-09 global financial crisis.⁠

⁠
Later this year, though, the three pandas living in the National Zoo will be sent to China, which has the rights to pandas in captivity all over the world. The departure of Tian Tian, a 26-year-old male, Mei Xiang, a 25-year-old female and their three-year old cub, Xiao Qi Ji, will leave Washington without at least one of the rotund, cuddly-looking bears for only the second time since Richard Nixon’s breakthrough with Beijing in 1972.⁠
⁠
The breakdown in U.S.-China relations is bamboozling many in the city. Norma Valentini, a 52-year-old registered nurse who grew up in D.C. visiting the pandas, is finding the farewell difficult to bear.⁠
⁠
“They’ve been here all my life,” she said. She comes to the zoo at least once a week these days to bid them goodbye. “It’s very, very sad.”⁠
⁠
By Dec. 7, the animals will return to Chinese conservationists, who have essentially been renting the adult pandas to the National Zoo, generally for about $1 million a year since 2000. Under the agreement—part of China’s global, soft-power “panda diplomacy”—cubs born in Washington go back to China, too.⁠
⁠
Zoo officials hope the pandas’ absence is short-lived and are applying for a fresh batch. They are still figuring out what to do without the zoo’s stars.⁠

“We have folks who come repeatedly for the giant pandas, so we’re going to see a drop in attendance for that,” said Pamela Baker-Masson, the zoo’s director of communications. “It’s hard to project. Are we going to stop selling panda plush in the stores? Probably not.”⁠

With her string of pearls and winsome smile, the lifelong outsider became a national icon. ⁠

Her book is concerned with the biggest question of all: Who am I? In essays on cross-dressing pre-transition, polyamory and living with attention-deficit disorder, Schneider introduces readers to the real, messy, complex Amy. ⁠

24-year-old Erica Robin, a Christian from the city of Karachi, is going to represent deeply conservative Pakistan at the Miss Universe beauty pageant.

Those criticising her nomination say she is representing a country that does not want to be represented, especially as beauty pageants are rare in Muslim-majority Pakistan.

In the competition's 72-year history, Pakistan has never nominated a representative for Miss Universe.

However Miss Pakistan World, a pageant for women of Pakistani descent from around the world, is a well-known contest, with various spin offs such as Miss Pakistan Universal, Mrs Pakistan Universal and even Miss Trans Pakistan.

Israeli troops and tanks attacked Gaza's main northern city from both sides on Monday, three days after they began a major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave that has stirred more international appeals for civilians to be protected.

Israel's military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as the war enters its fourth week. 

Israel renewed warnings for civilians to move from the north of the tiny, densely populated enclave to the south as it began an advance into Gaza late on Friday to pursue Hamas militants it says are hiding in a labyrinth of tunnels under Gaza City.

U.S. President Joe Biden did not call for military conscription in the United States in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict in October 2023, as suggested by an AI-generated video shared on social media.
 
The fabricated clip shows Biden speaking at a podium, saying that he is invoking the Selective Service Act, adding: “Remember, you are not sending your sons and daughters to war. You are sending them to freedom.” However, the video is not only fake, but a longer version of it predates the October conflict.

The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two. 

The International Criminal Court's founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are ""unwilling or unable"" to do so. On Tuesday, the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.

Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. It is backed by Shi’ite Iran and shares the Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was established in Egypt in the 1920s.
 
It is part of a regional alliance comprising Iran, Syria and the Shi’ite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which all broadly oppose U.S. policy in the Middle East and Israel.

Retaliatory strikes on Gaza have killed 1,055 people and wounded 5,184, and left around 250,000 homeless. Most of the displaced were in U.N.-designated shelters, with others huddling in the streets.

To many Americans, that violence feels like a growing threat to some of the freedoms that give meaning to everyday life: the right to worship in peace; to go to school; and to “the pursuit of happiness” that the nation’s founders so prized.

⁠
Some farmers lost 20% or more of their predicted yields; others, like Mazzotti, left some land bare. Labor costs and inflation are also narrowing margins, hitting farmers’ ability to profit off what they sell to garden centers and pumpkin patches.⁠
⁠
This year’s thirsty gourds are a symbol of the reality that farmers who rely on irrigation must continue to face season after season: they have to make choices, based on water allotments and the cost of electricity to pump it out of the ground, about which acres to plant and which crops they can gamble on to make it through hotter and drier summers.⁠
⁠
“It’s one of the worst years we’ve had in several years,” said Mark Carroll, a Texas A&M extension agent for Floyd County. Not only did the hot, dry weather surpass what irrigation could make up for, but pumpkins also need cooler weather to be harvested or they’ll start to decompose during the shipping process, sometimes disintegrating before they even arrive at stores.⁠

⁠
In a written report, the U.K.-based Internet Watch Foundation urges governments and technology providers to act quickly before a flood of AI-generated images of child sexual abuse overwhelms law enforcement investigators and vastly expands the pool of potential victims.⁠
⁠
“We’re not talking about the harm it might do,” said Dan Sexton, the watchdog group’s chief technology officer. “This is happening right now and it needs to be addressed right now.”⁠
In some cases, kids are using these tools on each other. At a school in southwestern Spain, police have been investigating teens’ alleged use of a phone app to make their fully dressed schoolmates appear nude in photos.⁠
⁠
The report exposes a dark side of the race to build generative AI systems that enable users to describe in words what they want to produce — from emails to novel artwork or videos — and have the system spit it out.⁠
⁠
If it isn’t stopped, the flood of deepfake child sexual abuse images could bog investigators down trying to rescue children who turn out to be virtual characters. Perpetrators could also use the images to groom and coerce new victims.⁠

⁠
The report out this week from the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion access, shows the number fell to nearly zero in states with the strictest bans — but rose elsewhere, especially in states close to those with the bans. The monthly averages overall from July 2022 through June 2023 were about 200 higher than in May and June 2022.⁠
⁠
The changes reflect major shifts after the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022 handed down its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had made abortion legal nationally. Since last year, most Republican-controlled states have enacted restrictions, while most Democrat-controlled states have extended protections for those from out of state seeking abortion.⁠
⁠
“The Dobbs decision turned abortion access in this country upside down,” Alison Norris, a co-chair for the study, known as WeCount, and a professor at The Ohio State University’s College of Public Health, said in a statement. “The fact that abortions increased overall in the past year shows what happens when abortion access is improved, and some previously unmet need for abortion is met.” But she noted that bans make access harder — and sometimes impossible — for some people.⁠

Not only are they delicious, but making your own crunchy pumpkin seeds means you get to make sure the amount of oil and salt remains within reason, and you also get to show your kids that not all snacks come in crinkly bags; sometimes they come in a pumpkin.⁠

⁠
The Emmy-nominated actor was found dead of an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home Saturday, according to the Los Angeles Times and celebrity website TMZ, which was the first to report the news. Both outlets cited unnamed sources confirming Perry’s death.⁠
⁠
His publicists and other representatives did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently confirm Perry’s death. Asked by AP to confirm police response to what was listed as Perry’s home address, LAPD Officer Drake Madison told The Associated Press that officers had gone there “for a death investigation of a male in his 50s.”⁠
⁠
Perry’s 10 seasons on “Friends” made him one of Hollywood’s most recognizable actors, starring opposite Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer as a friend group in New York.⁠
⁠
Perry received one Emmy nomination for his “Friends” role and two more for appearances as an associate White House counsel on “The West Wing.”⁠

With fewer employees working from the office, many businesses have abandoned large offices, leaving some downtown property owners struggling with half-empty buildings and city governments struggling with shrinking tax revenue.⁠
⁠
“This presents an area of opportunity to both increase housing supply while revitalizing main streets. It’s a win-win,” said Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council.⁠
⁠
Several of the new measures will be designed to specifically encourage the creation of new affordable housing units near transportation hubs like bus terminals and subway stations.⁠
⁠
“These downtowns and central business districts .. are already designed and oriented around public transit,” Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said. “Our intention is to make the most of this opportunity to add more housing near transit in ways that not only reduce the cost of housing but also reduce the cost of transportation.”⁠

⁠
The Jefferson School African American Heritage Center, a Charlottesville-based Black history museum, said Thursday that the statue had been destroyed.⁠
⁠
The Charlottesville City Council voted in 2021 to donate the statue to the heritage center, after it proposed a Swords into Plowshares project that would melt the statue and repurpose it into “public art that expresses the City’s values of inclusivity and racial justice,” according to the proposal submitted to the city.⁠
⁠
The statue was taken down in 2021 after years of debate and delay.⁠
⁠
Protests over the plan to remove the statue morphed into the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. It was during that rally that James Alex Fields Jr., an avowed Hitler admirer, intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. Fields is serving a life sentence.⁠
⁠
Two groups that had sought to preserve the statue sued last year to try to block the city from donating it to the heritage center, but a judge tossed out their case.⁠
⁠
At a news conference Thursday, heritage center officials said they now plan to solicit proposals on how to repurpose the statue. The center hopes to pick an artist next year and is conducting a $4 million fundraising campaign.⁠

The National Weather Service warned of hazardous travel on snowy mountain passes and ice on some highways when snow initially melts and then freezes as road temperatures drop.

Cold air moving down from northwestern Canada has combined with a moist Pacific weather system, leading to freezing temperatures and expected snowfall amounts up 14 inches in Washington’s northern Cascade Mountains and 18 inches in the mountains of Montana, the National Weather Service forecasts. Some higher elevations in the northern Rockies could see snow totals of 2 feet or more.

Central Montana will see the worst of the snow, said Matt Ludwig, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Great Falls.

Icelanders awoke to all-male news teams announcing shutdowns across the country, with public transport delayed, hospitals understaffed and hotel rooms uncleaned. Trade unions, the strike’s main organizers, called on women and nonbinary people to refuse paid and unpaid work, including chores. About 90% of the country’s workers belong to a union.

Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdóttir said she would stay home as part of the strike — “kvennaverkfall” in Icelandic — and expected other women in her Cabinet would do the same.
Iceland, a rugged island of around 380,000 people just below the Arctic Circle, has been ranked as the world’s most gender-equal country 14 years in a row by the World Economic Forum, which measures pay, education, health care and other factors.

No country has achieved full equality, and there remains a gender pay gap in Iceland.
Tuesday’s walkout, running from midnight to midnight, was billed as the biggest since Iceland’s first such event on Oct. 24, 1975, when 90% of women refused to work, clean or look after children, to voice anger at discrimination in the workplace.

Discarded by Europeans and Americans, these clothes are often purchased from wholesalers and then shipped to African countries by middlemen. It’s a multimillion-dollar business, with some two-thirds of people in seven countries in East Africa having “purchased at least a portion of their clothes from the secondhand clothing market,” according to a 2017 U.S. Agency for International Development study, the most recent with such details.⁠
⁠
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, a semi-authoritarian leader who has held power since 1986, declared in August that he was banning imports of used clothing, saying the items are coming “from dead people.”⁠
⁠
“When a white person dies, they gather their clothes and send them to Africa,” Museveni said.⁠
⁠
Trade authorities have not yet enforced the president’s order, which needs to be backed by a legal measure such as an executive order.⁠

Today, everything inside the six-family unit is chaos.⁠

The structure is one of many once luxurious houses in the island nation that in recent years have partially collapsed — or suffer visible damage.⁠

Residents say they have repeatedly asked authorities for help to no avail. Years of neglect, inclement weather and a deepening economic crisis only aggravate the fear that their home will eventually collapse.⁠

The Cuban government has in the past acknowledged the problem of housing deterioration, but says the lack of material resources prevents it from tackling it. Yet, many Cubans wonder why the pace of investment in tourism megaprojects such as hotels — a vital business sector that has failed to take off in at least the last two years — is not slowing down to address the dire housing crisis.⁠

But the recent shift toward e-cigarettes that can’t be refilled has created a new environmental dilemma. The devices, which contain nicotine, lithium and other metals, cannot be reused or recycled. Under federal environmental law, they also aren’t supposed to go in the trash.⁠

Teams rushed to flood its roots with water, hoping to save a magnificent tree that had provided shade for community events, a picturesque wedding venue and a popular backdrop for posing tourists.⁠
⁠
But the fire also nearly wiped out another set of trees, one with a much longer history in Lahaina and a greater significance in Hawaiian culture: the breadfruit tree, or ulu, which had given sustenance since Polynesian voyagers introduced it to the islands many centuries ago. Before colonialism, commercial agriculture and tourism, thousands of breadfruit trees dotted Lahaina. The fire charred all but two of the dozen or so that remained.⁠
⁠
Now, as Maui recovers from the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, which left at least 98 people dead, a band of arborists, farmers and landscapers has set about trying to save Lahaina’s ulu, kukui nut and other culturally important trees. In some cases this means digging down to the roots of badly burned specimens to find live tissue that could be used to propagate new shoots.⁠
⁠
They see the destruction as a chance to restore the trees to Lahaina, to teach about their care and use, and to reclaim a bit of the town’s historic identity amid a larger discussion about whether the community’s reconstruction will price out locals and Hawaiian culture in favor of deep-pocketed outsiders seeking a slice of tropical paradise.⁠

The carnage began with a violent cross-border attack by Hamas militants on Israeli civilians. Israel’s retaliatory response was swift, and by mid-week, the full destructive force of its military was bearing down on the Gaza Strip amid threats of a ground invasion.

The toll has brought unimaginable grief for Israelis and Palestinians alike. In wrenching scenes, relatives weep over the dead or missing, whose lives were suddenly and violently cut short in an erupting war that has shattered thousands of families.

⁠
The order from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan marks a milestone moment in the federal case that accuses Trump of illegally conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.⁠
⁠
Chutkan said Trump is entitled to criticize the Justice Department generally and assert his belief that the case is politically motivated, but she said Trump can’t mount a “smear campaign” against prosecutors and court personnel.⁠
⁠
“No other criminal defendant would be allowed to do so, and I’m not going to allow it in this case,” Chutkan said.⁠
⁠
Chutkan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, said she would impose “sanctions as may be necessary” if the gag order is violated, but she wasn’t more specific. Judges can threaten gag order violators with fines or jail time, but jailing a presidential candidate could prompt serious political blowback and pose logistical hurdles.⁠

APNews,CybLg0QMin9,2023-10-15 15:35:21,GraphSidecar,"In a three-story building tucked in a Kabul alleyway, a group of women work silently at a loom. Zamarod’s hands move swiftly, nimble fingers flitting between strands of yarn as she knots colored wool around them, making a carpet. Her movements are rapid, almost brusque, but her voice is soft and sad. “My life is like a prisoner,” she says. “Like a bird in a cage.” ⁠
⁠
The 20-year-old had been studying computer science, but the Taliban banned women from universities before she could graduate. Now she and her 23-year-old sister work in a carpet factory, falling back on a skill their mother taught them as children. They are among very few women who can earn money outside the home and, like others, asked that only their first names be used for fear of retribution for speaking out. ⁠
⁠
Women have experienced the starkest changes since the Taliban’s return. They must adhere to a strict dress code, are banned from most jobs and denied simple pleasures such as visiting a park or going to a restaurant. Girls can no longer attend school beyond sixth grade, and women must be escorted by a male relative to travel. ⁠
⁠
For all intents and purposes, women have been being erased from public life. ⁠
⁠
Even in this environment, Zamarod hasn’t given up on her dream of graduating. “We have to have hope. We hope that one day we will be free, that freedom is possible,” she says. “That’s why we live and breathe.”⁠
⁠
In another room, 50-year-old Hakima is introducing her teenage daughter Freshta to weaving. It is their only way of eking out a living, though she still dreams her 16-year-old daughter will someday become a doctor. “Afghanistan has gone backwards,” she says, donning an all-encompassing burka to pose for a portrait. “People go door to door for a piece of bread and our children are dying.” ⁠
⁠
While the clock has turned back for women who’ve lost financial independence and a voice in public life and government, in conservative, tribal parts of the country, expectations for women have always been different and have changed little over the years — even during U.S. and NATO military presence. ⁠

There are no witnesses except, possibly, a border collie named Snoop. The couple’s 11-year-old son is blind. Authorities charge Sandra with murder.

The Emmy-nominated actor always assumed “Zilot & Other Important Rhymes,” which hit shelves Tuesday, would be a project he completed once his son and daughter had long been out of the house. “Maybe when I was a grandpa,” he mused.⁠
⁠
But when the entire family hunkered down under the same roof for the better part of 2020, he and his daughter Erin, the younger of the two siblings, wanted to create something that fosters wonder and joy in children in the midst of abundant despair.⁠
⁠
“We tried to make the most of the limitations, the situation. But you know, that was a hard time for everyone in the country,” Odenkirk recalled of the coronavirus pandemic. “Erin’s an illustrator and an artist. And I thought, ‘Let’s just get to work on that book.’”⁠
⁠
So they dusted off the whimsical rhymes they had collaborated on nearly two decades ago, and ""Zilot & Other Important Rhymes"" was born.⁠

⁠
The footprints were discovered at the edge of an ancient lakebed in White Sands National Park and date back to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, according to research published in the journal Science.⁠
⁠
The estimated age of the footprints was first reported in Science in 2021, but some researchers raised concerns about the dates. Questions focused on whether seeds of aquatic plants used for the original dating may have absorbed ancient carbon from the lake — which could, in theory, throw off radiocarbon dating by thousands of years.⁠
⁠
The new study presents two additional lines of evidence for the older date range. It uses two entirely different materials found at the site, ancient conifer pollen and quartz grains.⁠
⁠
The reported age of the footprints challenges the once-conventional wisdom that humans didn’t reach the Americas until a few thousand years before rising sea levels covered the Bering land bridge between Russia and Alaska, perhaps about 15,000 years ago.⁠

For nearly all of Mohammadi’s life, Iran has been governed by a Shiite theocracy headed by the country’s supreme leader. While women hold jobs, academic positions and even government appointments, their lives can be tightly controlled. Laws require all women to at least wear a headscarf, or hijab, to cover their hair as a sign of piety. Iran and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only countries that mandate it.⁠
⁠
In a statement to the @nytimes, Mohammadi said the “global support and recognition of my human rights advocacy makes me more resolved, more responsible, more passionate and more hopeful.”⁠
⁠
“I also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organized,” she added. “Victory is near.”⁠

Setting out his plan at the annual Conservative Party conference, Sunak said he wanted to “stop teenagers taking up cigarettes in the first place.”⁠

It is currently illegal for anyone to sell cigarettes or tobacco products to people under 18 years old throughout the U.K.⁠

Sunak’s office said the incremental changes would stop children who turn 14 this year and those younger than that now from ever legally being sold cigarettes in England.⁠
⁠
If Parliament approves the proposal, the legal change would only apply in England — not in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.⁠
The government said that smoking won’t be criminalized, and the phased changes mean that anyone who can legally buy cigarettes now won’t be prevented from doing so in the future.⁠

⁠
Kaiser Permanente is one of the country’s larger insurers and health care system operators, with 39 hospitals nationwide. The non-profit company, based in Oakland, California, provides health coverage for nearly 13 million people, sending customers to clinics and hospitals it runs or contracts with to provide care.⁠
⁠
The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, representing about 85,000 of the health system's employees nationally, approved a strike for three days in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, and for one day in Virginia and Washington, D.C.⁠
⁠
The strikers include licensed vocational nurses, home health aides and ultrasound sonographers, as well as technicians in radiology, X-ray, surgical, pharmacy and emergency departments.⁠
⁠
Doctors are not participating, and Kaiser says its hospitals, including emergency rooms, will remain open during the picketing. The company said it was bringing in thousands of temporary workers to fill gaps during the strike. But the strike could lead to delays in getting appointments and non-urgent procedures being rescheduled.⁠
⁠
It comes amid unprecedented worker organizing — from strike authorizations to work stoppages — within multiple industries this year, including, transportation, entertainment and hospitality.⁠
⁠
Wednesday's strike is the latest one for the health care industry this year as it continues to confront burnout with the heavy workloads — problems that were exacerbated greatly by the pandemic.⁠

Mining operations account for some 4%-7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. But some miners are moving to reduce use of fossil fuels in extracting and refining, partly due to pressure from downstream customers that want more sustainable supply chains.⁠

Experts say improved technology, pressure from customers and enforcement of clean energy policies all are needed to keep moving toward more sustainable mining and refining practices while raising output to keep pace with global needs for pivoting away from reliance on polluting fossil fuels.⁠

It first emerged after the Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel seized control of the West Bank and Gaza, and annexed East Jerusalem. At the time, the Israeli government made public displays of the Palestinian flag a criminal offense in Gaza and the West Bank.

To circumvent the ban, Palestinians began using the watermelon because, when cut open, the fruit bears the national colors of the Palestinian flag—red, black, white, and green.

Known as the ""Reign of Terror,"" the murders were committed at a point in time when the Osage were considered the richest people per capita in the world following the discovery of oil reserves under their land.

The fifth season of Netflix’s #LoveIsBlind turned out to be a season that couldn’t even put a happy face on its so-called social experiment by marrying off one reasonably sympathetic couple.

After a relatively low-conflict fourth season that resulted in three marriages out of four couples, fans have been savoring the drama of the show’s latest episodes, featuring singles from Houston.

Yet, when you remember that there are real people behind the breathless headlines, the show’s soapy mess keeps getting harder to enjoy. And as the deceptions, delusions, and alleged abuses of this past season of ‘Love Is Blind’ have underscored, nothing good can come of so much reality-TV artifice masquerading as true romance.

“It seems fair to conclude that the highly stage-managed environment of reality dating just isn’t healthy,” Berman writes, for the contestants, or the viewers.

Studies have suggested that between 6% and 18% of still-married American couples have been through a period of separation. 

There are many reasons people separate but don't divorce. ""It's hard, emotionally, for people to get divorced,"" says matrimonial lawyer Paul Talbert. ""It's harder than just saying we're going to separate and try this out.""

For months, the primary culprit for the shortage was believed to be an ongoing increase in prescription rates and ADHD diagnoses, which spiked between 2020 and 2021. Adderall's active ingredient is a controlled amphetamine salt, and its production requires communication between the FDA, drug companies, and the DEA, which sets an annual cap on the amount of highly-controlled amphetamines that manufacturers can use.

Recently, however, it’s become more and more clear that something else is also going on—and that nobody wants to be responsible for figuring out what it is.

Time,CyghtPZxrW2,2023-10-17 17:25:27,GraphSidecar,"Since the Israeli military issued an order last week for the 1.1 million Palestinians living in northern Gaza to flee south, in an apparent prelude to its anticipated ground invasion, a mass exodus has ensued. While those with enough fuel have made the journey by car or truck, others have hitched rides on trailers and donkey carts. Some have even resorted to making the perilous journey on foot.

This kind of mass relocation of civilians amid regular airstrikes was never going to be easy. Both the United Nations and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders dubbed the task “impossible,” citing the logistical nightmare of relocating half of Gaza’s population—among them women, children, and the elderly—without any guarantees for their safety. Indeed, there have been reports by the Financial Times and others of at least one designated safe route out of northern Gaza being subject to an airstrike resulting in as many as 70 deaths. Hamas blames Israel for the attack—a charge that the IDF denies. 

“What’s being done doesn’t meet the legal standards for what an evacuation should entail,” Shaina Low, a communications adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council, tells TIME from the NEC’s office in East Jerusalem. “It should be orderly; there should be safety.” Indeed, while Israel may order an evacuation for imperative military reasons or to protect civilians, international law requires that it provides those being displaced with adequate shelter, hygiene, health, safety, and nutrition.

In Gaza, all of these things have been in short supply since Israel began its bombardment of the densely-populated Strip in retaliation for Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, in which militants killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Since then, Gaza has been under complete siege, cut off from food, water, and electricity. Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 2,670 people, roughly a quarter of them children.

Time,Cyd_zVdssQR,2023-10-16 17:50:42,GraphSidecar,"Before mining came to Chhattisgarh, a landlocked state in central India, Hasdeo Arand was a remote forest with a dozen tribal hamlets. Spanning more than 650 square miles, the forest is often called the “lungs of central India” and is home to endangered elephants, sloth bears, and leopards, as well as valuable water reserves. Many of the local villagers are Adivasis, or “original inhabitants” hailing from the Gond tribe, who cultivate crops in their backyards and sell woven grass baskets at the market. For them, this land is sacred.

The area’s nearly 250 plant and bird species aren’t the forest’s only resources. Umeshwar Singh Armo remembers when, as a schoolboy, he learned about another one: a shiny substance called “coal.” But it wasn’t until 2007 that surveyors sent by the state government began roaming the forest, using satellite cameras and laser scans to look for the stuff.

What the surveyors found was a miner’s jackpot: more than 5 billion tons of coal sitting under the pristine forest. In 2013, Chhattisgarh’s government marked out coal blocks, or designated areas for mining, and gave approval to Rajasthan, another state government, to extract the fuel. The Rajasthan government contracted the mining operations to Adani Power, India’s largest private operator and developer of coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Shortly after, a chunk of the forest roughly the size of five football fields was torn out to establish the Parsa-East Kanta Basan (PEKB) mine, named after two hamlets that once stood on the land. Today, what remains are large black craters.

India is pulling back on coal, but the damage is already done.

Time,CyXyoq2uRVd,2023-10-14 08:00:13,GraphSidecar,"Over the last 30 years, 60 countries have liberalized abortion law, with only four rolling back its legality: the U.S., Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Poland. 

Officially in 2020, there were seven maternal deaths in Poland. In 2021, there were nine. 

Such low figures have persisted for more than a decade, but experts say the data is unreliable. 

“Every year we estimate that there are almost three times as many deaths as appear in the statistics. If a patient dies in the intensive care unit, for example, and not in the gynecology and obstetrics department, nothing in the certificate will link her death to the pregnancy,” says Dr. Katarzyna Szamotulska, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at the Mother and Child Institute in Warsaw. (Poland’s Ministry of Health declined to answer multiple requests for comment about the reliability of the statistics.) 

With doctors reluctant to intervene, infant mortality rates have also risen, says Dr. Gizela Jagielska, the deputy director of the public hospital in Olesnica and a gynecologist who performs many of the few legal abortions that still take place in Poland.

Time,CyWOUWguPth,2023-10-13 17:23:37,GraphSidecar,"Abortion has been illegal in Poland since 1993, but a 2020 ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, which went into effect the next year, removed one of the exceptions to the law—fetal abnormalities—and imposed a near-total ban on abortion.

Now women can terminate a pregnancy only if the women’s life or health is at risk (including mental health risks with a psychiatric diagnosis) or if there is reasonable suspicion that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

Yet what the law allows is not actually what is happening in practice, as examples from across the country indicate. The consequences of the reproductive-rights rollback have been dire.

Women who have abortions are not prosecuted under the law, but doctors and others who help women terminate pregnancies, up to the point of viability, may face up to three years in prison. If an abortion takes place beyond the point of viability, then the person who aided in the abortion may face up to eight years in prison. 

This creates what many consider a “chilling effect,” as doctors scared of running afoul of the law hesitate to take lifesaving steps for pregnant patients.

All Democrats present and 8 Republicans supported the measure in a 216-210 vote that followed an hour of floor debate, during which hard-right Republicans railed against their own leader and verbally sparred with his defenders while Democrats listened silently.

His new thriller, The Exchange, is a sequel to The Firm, the legal thriller set in Memphis that established him as a force in publishing and Hollywood alike. The movie version released 30 years ago, starring Tom Cruise as lawyer Mitch McDeere, remains his highest-grossing adaptation. His publisher says the new book was inspired in part by Cruise’s comeback turn in Top Gun: Maverick last year. Its release is a milestone that has Grisham feeling reflective. “When I started writing the book in January of this year, I really got nostalgic,” he tells me.

The baby boy was delivered by emergency cesarean section as his mother was on her last breaths. She had been badly wounded in an Israeli air attack on her home in northern Gaza, which killed her husband and nine other relatives.⁠

Son of Maryam al-Harsh was born on October 13 at 32 weeks, alive and with a faint heartbeat. He was immediately transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Shifa Hospital, and put on mechanical ventilation.⁠

With the Gaza Strip’s healthcare system on the brink of collapse, it is hard to know whether the besieged territory’s 130 premature babies in the enclave’s seven neonatal ICUs will survive, as the health ministry warned that they are in imminent danger if fuel does not reach hospitals soon.⁠

.⁠
The signatories of the letter, which Al Jazeera has seen, say they “hardly recognise the values of the EU”, claiming there is a “seeming indifference demonstrated over the past few days by our institution towards the ongoing massacre of civilians in the Gaza Strip, in disregard for human rights and international humanitarian law”.⁠
.⁠
They say they are saddened by the Commission’s “double standards”, since it considers the blockade of Ukraine by Russia as an act of terror, while Israel’s blockade of Gaza is “completely ignored”.⁠
.⁠
“If Israel does not stop immediately, the whole Gaza Strip and its inhabitants will be erased from the planet,” the letter read.⁠
.⁠
“We urge you [von der Leyen] to call, together with the leaders of the whole Union, for a ceasefire and for the protection of civilian life. This is at the core of the EU existence,” they said, warning “the EU risks losing all credibility”.⁠
.⁠
The letter represents deep divisions within the bloc on how to approach the Israel-Gaza war, which in less than two weeks has killed thousands of people.⁠
.⁠
The European Commission’s “recent unfortunate actions or positions seem to give a free hand to the acceleration and the legitimacy of a war crime in the Gaza Strip”, the letter said.⁠
.⁠
In Gaza, more than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them children.⁠
.⁠
“We would have been proud if the European Union … had called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and indiscriminate violence against civilians,” the letter read.⁠
.⁠
The call on von der Leyen follows other signs of political friction in the West, with reports that US diplomats are preparing a “dissent cable” on the Middle East war, a document criticising Washington’s policy that goes to State Department leaders.⁠

.⁠
One of Gaza’s 1,000 Christians, Jahsan never doubted the church was a safe space for him, his pregnant wife and two children aged five and six. The Greek Orthodox church – the oldest in the city, located in the Zaytoun neighbourhood – has traditionally served as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims during Israel’s periodic wars against Gaza.⁠
.⁠
The church was sheltering hundreds of people when an Israeli bomb severely damaged one of the four buildings in its compound on Thursday evening, causing its ceiling to collapse and leaving dozens trapped under slabs of concrete, according to witnesses.⁠
.⁠
By Friday afternoon, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem told Al Jazeera at least 18 people were confirmed to have been killed, including several children.⁠
.⁠
“The building that they bombed is beside the church,” said Jahsan, still shaken from what he says was a massive blast. “We just pray to god to end this war.”⁠
.⁠
About 200 children, women, elderly and sick people were taking shelter at the church when Israeli warplanes targeted the building with two raids, said Ibrahim Al-Souri, another survivor who had also been taking shelter.⁠
.⁠
“We thought we would be protected by the church but unfortunately the brutal Israeli occupation does not differentiate,” he said. “They have targeted churches, mosques and hospitals. There is no safe place.”⁠
.⁠
Al-Souri called on free people around the world to pressure their governments to stop the bloodshed against Palestinians.⁠

.⁠
Josh Paul, a director in the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, wrote in a note published online on Wednesday that the administration of President Joe Biden was repeating the same mistakes Washington has been making for decades.⁠
.⁠
“The response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people,” he wrote.⁠
.⁠
“I fear we are repeating the same mistakes we have made these past decades, and I decline to be a part of it for longer,” he said, adding that the Biden administration’s “blind support for one side” was leading to policy decisions that were “shortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse”.⁠
.⁠
“I knew it was not without its moral complexity and moral compromises, and I made myself a promise that I would stay for as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do,” wrote Paul who was involved in arms transfers to US allies for more than 11 years.⁠
.⁠
“I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued – indeed, expanded and expedited – provision of lethal arms to Israel I have reached the end of that bargain,” he said.⁠
.⁠
In an interview with The New York Times, Paul also said that “continuing to give Israel what he described as carte blanche to kill a generation of enemies, only to create a new one, does not ultimately serve the United States’ interests”.⁠

“What it leads to is this desire to sort of impose security at any cost, including in cost to the Palestinian civilian population,” he told the US publication. “And that doesn’t ultimately lead to security.”⁠

After its establishment through terror and violence, the tiny colonial entity developed a formidable security doctrine that matches its heightened perception of threats – real and imagined – from a cynical world, a hostile region, and a defiant indigenous population.""⁠

While President Joe Biden has strongly condemned bigotry “in all its forms” since the start of the war, Arab advocates say his administration’s approach to the conflict is fuelling hatred against their communities.⁠

Since last Saturday, at least 55 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,100 others wounded.⁠

According to human rights activist Samir Abu Shams, the Israeli army is in violation of multiple international laws, particularly the Geneva Conventions, which stress that civilians should be unharmed in situations of war and armed conflict.⁠
.⁠
“What we are seeing today is that the occupation forces enter civilian areas, create friction, and target civilians with gunfire without any justification,” the 60-year-old from Tulkarem said. “Most of the cases of Israeli gunfire have been against Palestinian civilians passing through the street or going to their place of work.”⁠
.⁠
On the one hand, Abu Shams went on to say, the Israeli occupation isolates the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.⁠
.⁠
“On the other, it takes revenge on civilians in the occupied West Bank and takes measures to arm settlers and gives instructions to open fire on men, women, and children,” he said.⁠

Despite having one billion fans, the sport remains largely limited to a handful of countries, with India leading the way. The sport's barriers to entry, high costs, and cultural ties to Commonwealth countries, have hindered its expansion.⁠

“Cricket has a relatively high barrier to entry compared to most sports, simply due to the level of equipment required to play even a recreational game,” said Matt Roller, assistant editor at the ESPNCricinfo website. “In my view, that is the principal reason that football has long been a global sport: All you need is a ball and any small space.”⁠

Unlike football's FIFA, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has only 12 full members, with dozens of other nations as associate members.⁠

Tunisia once boasted a Jewish community of 100,000. By 1967, Jews began fleeing a wave of anti-Jewish attacks en masse. 40,000 of them went to Israel. 

With the Tunisian revolution in 2011, anti-Jewish sentiment began sweeping the country again. Soon after the revolution, a Hamas leader visited Tunis and, upon arrival at the airport, shouted, “Kill the Jews!” A couple of months after that incident, a crowd of Salafi Muslims gathered in front of Tunis’s Grand Synagogue shouting anti-Jewish slogans, led by a cleric who urged Muslims to “rise up and wage a war against the Jews.”

The El-Hamma tomb site of Rabbi Yosef Ma’aravi (pictured here) was also ransacked in 2011. El-Hamma no longer has a Jewish community. However, pilgrimages to Rabbi Yosef Ma’arabi tomb occur on an annual basis during the day of the month of Teveth.

The country's last kosher restaurant closed in 2015. Today, 1000 Jews remain.

The meme is an online image of President Biden with red laser eyes, meant to portray the president as powerful. The name stems from the Republican rallying cry, “Let’s Go Brandon,” which is a euphemism for an expletive against Biden. But White House staffers began embracing the “Dark Brandon” meme last summer, and the president’s re-election campaign has used it as an icon, too.

Despite more than two hours of closed-door discussions, differences remained, with the U.S. calling for “humanitarian pauses” and many council members demanding a “humanitarian cease-fire.”

The journals are filled with letters written by women minutes after having had abortions.

Some of them detail the reasons they chose to undergo the procedure. Others have messages of encouragement for the next women who will be in their position. 

Clinics like Fundación ILE have been legal in Mexico City for 16 years, after a groundbreaking 2007 decision decriminalized abortion in the capital state. Other Mexican states have individually followed suit. Then, in September, the country's Supreme Court voted to decriminalize the procedure nationwide, marking a contrast to growing abortion restrictions in many U.S. states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

But in a culturally conservative country where nearly 80% of the population identifies as Catholic and femicide is seen as a national emergency, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruling does little to quell the social stigmas that continue to drive the conversation around abortion and women’s reproductive rights. The next phase of the fight, advocates and experts say, is a process of “social decriminalization” that can be even more challenging than the legal battles.

Classified as a big-game species, it is illegal under Arizona state law to injure or kill them, “even if they are causing a problem.”

“When you come upon them and see them, it’s like The Tasmanian Devil,” Seven Canyons general manager Dave Bisbee told CNN.

The club will have spent between $150,000 and $300,000 in labor costs by the time the javelinas back away, Bisbee estimates, with a further $50,000 to $75,000 spent on additional seed, turf growth blankets and other restorative equipment.

Thousands of people fled Al-Shifa over the weekend as Israeli troops encircled it. On Monday, the World Health Organization warned of a “dire and perilous” situation for patients. The health organization said in a statement that Al-Shifa “is not functioning as a hospital anymore,” after having run out of fuel and water, putting the lives of patients at risk.

Looking after a sick family member can mean putting your own life on hold, often with little recognition or outside support.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls caregivers the “backbone” of long-term home care in the U.S., has warned that caregivers face many risks, including anxiety, depression, chronic health conditions and financial strain. Yet experts said that many caregivers feel they cannot speak openly about their frustration and anger, and that it is important to normalize those feelings.

Dozens of corpses are decomposing at the Al-Shifa Hospital because there is no way to preserve or remove them, a head nurse and a health official said.

The hospital and other medical centers in Gaza City had been struggling for weeks to maintain operations as supplies of fuel and medicine dwindled. The Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said on Monday that Israeli military vehicles had advanced to the gates of the hospital complex.

Patients at Al-Shifa have been dying because of a lack of power, according to doctors and Gazan health officials. Jihan Miqdad, a head nurse in the emergency room at Al-Shifa, said in a phone interview on Monday that patients who were on life support in the intensive care unit were dying because there was no oxygen.

“The situation here is catastrophic in every sense of the word,” she said.

Israeli security officials say that Hamas has built a vast command complex under the hospital, making it a legitimate military target. Hamas has denied the allegations, as has Al-Shifa’s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who has called them “untrue.”

A spokesman for the Gazan Health Ministry, Dr. ​​Medhat Abbas, said in a phone interview that more than 100 bodies were lying in the hospital’s front yard, another 50 were inside and around 60 were in the morgue.

Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri, was built during World War II and has made nearly all the rifle cartridges used by the U.S. military since it pulled out of Vietnam.

In recent years, it has also pumped billions of rounds of military-grade ammunition into the commercial market, an investigation by The New York Times found, leaving the “LC” signature scattered across crime scenes, including the sites of some of the nation’s most heinous mass shootings.

The plant, operated by a private contractor with Army oversight, is now one of the country’s biggest manufacturers of commercial rounds for the popular AR-15, and it remains so even as the U.S. government supplies ammunition to Ukraine.

A vast majority of Lake City rounds sold by retailers have been purchased by law-abiding citizens, including hunters, farmers and target shooters. Some of those people are drawn to the ammunition because it’s made with the same materials, and often to the same specifications, as the military’s. Others see the rounds as authentic accessories for their tactical weapons and gear.

But more than one million pages of search warrants, police evidence logs, ballistics reports, forfeiture records and court proceedings compiled by The Times provide a sweeping accounting of how Lake City ammunition, once intended for war, has also cut a criminal path through towns and cities in nearly all 50 states.

The results amounted to a resounding victory for abortion rights, proving once again that the issue can energize a broad coalition of Democrats, independents and even some moderate Republicans.

The Ferrari was one of 34 produced by Ferrari and one of only two GTO models ever raced by Ferrari’s own team, Scuderia Ferrari, the auction house said. It initially sold in 1964 for about $6,000, Sotheby’s said.⁠
⁠
The auction house made the unusual move of using the car as part of its high-profile New York series of fall auctions—bidding began just before its evening sale of modern art—as a way to underscore the fact that collectors are now willing to pay as much for a vintage vehicle as they would a masterpiece painting.⁠

WSJ,CzmFqWDMzkk,2023-11-13 17:47:18,GraphImage,"Nearly three years into an experiment that proponents hoped would spark a nationwide relaxation of drug laws, many in Oregon have turned against the decriminalization initiative known as Measure 110, which passed with 58% support in 2020. ⁠
⁠
People sprawled on sidewalks and using fentanyl with no fear of consequence have become a common sight in cities such as Eugene and Portland. Business owners and local leaders are upset, but so are liberal voters who hoped decriminalization would lead to more people getting help. In reality, few drug users are taking advantage of new state-funded rehabilitation programs.⁠
⁠
Change appears likely. A coalition of city officials, police chiefs and district attorneys recently called on the state legislature to recriminalize hard drugs. A measure to do so is in the works for next year’s ballot. A recent poll found the majority of Oregonians support the idea.⁠
⁠
The fundamental problem, according to law-enforcement officers and researchers, is that the threat of jail time hasn’t been replaced with a new incentive for people struggling with addiction to seek treatment.⁠
⁠
Some 6,000 tickets have been issued for drug possession since decriminalization went into effect in 2021, but just 92 people have called and completed assessments needed to connect them to services, according to the nonprofit that operates the helpline. The only penalty for those who don’t call is a $100 fine, which is rarely enforced.⁠
⁠
Advocates of drug decriminalization blame Oregon’s continued problems on nationwide trends, including the rise of deadly fentanyl and increased homelessness.⁠
⁠
They say Measure 110 is already succeeding at one of its goals: keeping people out of the criminal-justice system for drug possession. About 4,000 people were arrested for drug offenses in Oregon in 2022, down from 11,000 in 2020.⁠

⁠
These days, too few people are voluntarily leaving their jobs.⁠
⁠
Turnover has declined so steeply at some large employers that companies now find themselves over budget on certain teams, requiring leaders to weigh whether to postpone projects or to cut additional staff as the end of year approaches. Other bosses worry about how to keep star employees engaged when there are far fewer vacant positions internally, making it harder to move people into new roles.⁠
⁠
The decline in quitting would seem a welcome development for bosses who spent years bemoaning high levels of job-hopping and rapidly rising salaries. But some executives said they have been caught by surprise at how quickly the labor-market dynamics flipped, posing new challenges.⁠
⁠
Morgan Stanley had layoffs in recent months in part because of low attrition within the 80,000-person Wall Street firm, CEO James Gorman said on a call with investors in mid-October.⁠
⁠
Employers try to accurately predict how many staffers will quit in a given year to help set budgets for teams and establish hiring plans. Software company ServiceNow uses a machine-learning model to anticipate the number of employees it expects will step down each quarter. Voluntary turnover this year has fallen below levels forecast by those models, said Sarah Tilley, senior vice president of global talent. She didn’t cite specific figures, but attrition among top-performing employees in 2023 is less than half of what it was in 2022.⁠

In his spare time, he also tackles another impenetrable riddle of the galaxy: What is the best way to board airplanes?⁠
⁠
Steffen’s frustration with the boarding process began with an unpleasant trip to the airport in Seattle, where he waited in many lines. He thought the last one, at the jet bridge, was unnecessary.⁠
⁠
“There should be a solution to this—no matter how weird it might be,” the 48-year-old said.⁠
⁠
His annoyance, which you don’t have to be an astrophysicist to understand, led him to develop what he says is the optimal boarding strategy.⁠
⁠
Here’s how it works: The first person to board a single-aisle jet like a Boeing 737 is the passenger in the window seat of the last row. Say that’s 30A. The next person would be exactly two rows away in 28A, followed by 26A, 24A and 22A until the window seats in even rows on the right side were full. Next are the window seats in even rows on the left side: 30F, 28F, 26F and so on. Then come window seats in odd rows on the right and left starting from the back. The same patterns apply to middle seats and aisle seats until the last person on board plops into the front row.⁠
⁠
The idea is to reduce the probability of traffic jams. If the primary bottleneck of the boarding process is people waiting in the aisle, mostly because of how long it takes for others to load their luggage, Steffen’s fix maximizes the number of passengers stuffing their bags into overhead bins simultaneously. It takes a serial process (one at a time) and makes it parallel (several at a time).⁠
⁠
Steffen’s academic theories might be too idealistic to overcome the realities of the business, but it’s still worth exploring why they work.⁠

⁠
The increased demand for treatment exacerbated a shortage of available mental-health services. This has left desperate families pouring into emergency departments that legally can turn no one away. ⁠
⁠
The influx of young mental-health patients is overcrowding emergency departments and delaying treatment across the country at both specialized children’s hospitals and general hospitals. Major pediatric and emergency medicine organizations issued a public warning to hospitals and doctors in August, stating that the lack of space and available staff is forcing children who need psychiatric care to wait too long in E.R.s. ⁠
⁠
Andrea Teague, an oncologist in Santa Fe, N.M., has struggled to get help for her teenage daughter Iris, who suffers from depression and an eating disorder. The lone therapist Teague knew of in Santa Fe specializing in adolescent eating disorders had a six-month wait list. An Albuquerque program was temporarily closed. ⁠
⁠
Teague eventually found residential facilities, but it took weeks to get her in. After being discharged from one facility, Iris tried to kill herself. After a mental-health evaluation, Iris, who had just turned 18, was transferred to an adult psychiatric unit at an Albuquerque hospital, where she was discharged after five days with a treatment plan that would have required her to wait months for a psychiatrist.⁠
⁠
Teague used her medical connections to cobble together a treatment plan, which includes a local therapist and a dietitian from Colorado who helps her daughter remotely. ⁠
⁠
“She was in a crisis that required relatively urgent intervention, where waiting meant putting her life in danger,” Teague said. ⁠

⁠
Other cars designed by her father include the Lil Redd Wrecker, a build he made for the Redd Foxx TV show “Sanford and Son,” and a hot rod mail carrier called the Zip Code Mail Truck. He also worked on the Macabre Mobile from the 1988 film “Elvira: Mistress of the Dark.”⁠
⁠
Barris, aka the “King of the Kustomizers,” started out in the 1950s and moved to Los Angeles when hid designs started gaining popularity. In the mid-1960s, a producer asked him to build a car for a new TV series called “Batman.” The studio gave him 15 days to build a Batmobile, Barris-Paster says.⁠
⁠
“When my father first saw the 1966 TV Batmobile coming out of the Bat Cave on the set, he thought: ‘You can’t see the car. It’s too dark.’ So he painted the red-orange stripes,” she said. ⁠
⁠
Today, Barris-Paster keeps some of her father’s show cars in a private space in Los Angeles and others at a shop in Ventura County, Calif., shown here. ⁠

⁠
Emma Platt, 41, a U.K.-based graphic designer, bought a set of coat hangers labeled as “small” from the Chinese fashion site Shein for her part-time business selling secondhand children’s clothes.⁠
⁠
“I probably couldn’t fit anything but Barbie clothes on there,” Platt said of the mini hangers that arrived. ⁠
⁠
It turns out it’s not uncommon. Online marketplaces sell tiny pink cowboy hats. They also sell miniature pencil sharpeners, palm-size kitchen utensils, scaled-down books and itsy-bitsy camping chairs. Many of the minuscule objects aren’t clearly advertised.⁠
⁠
Shoppers have gotten lazy when clicking “buy” and assume—often wrongly—what size they’re getting, said Brendan Witcher, a principal analyst at research and advisory firm Forrester. But there is no doubt some online sellers deliberately trick customers into buying smaller and often cheaper-to-produce items, he said.⁠
⁠
Common tactics include displaying products against a white background rather than in room sets or on models, or photographing items with a perspective that makes them appear bigger than they really are. Dimensions can be hidden deep in the product description, or not included at all.⁠
⁠
In those instances, the duped consumer “may say, well, it’s only $1, $2, maybe $3—what’s the harm?” Witcher said. When the item arrives the shopper may be confused, amused or frustrated, but unlikely to complain or demand a refund.⁠

The cost of admissions and fees for entertainment rose faster than the cost of many staple goods last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That has helped raise standards for the amount of fun we expect for our money—and triggered quick disappointment when our experiences don’t live up to the price. ⁠
⁠
Someone who scores cheap flights to Europe may give the trip five stars before the plane even boards. Someone who spends half their paycheck on playoff tickets may get cranky about it by halftime. ⁠

And people are spending for now. Corie Barry, Best Buy’s CEO, said at a conference last month that “experiences are really where people are willing to pay” and that this was dragging on demand for expensive electronics. ⁠

Studies on money and happiness tell us that paying for experiences tends to bring us greater pleasures than buying stuff, because those experiences can deliver payoffs before, during and after they happen. ⁠
⁠
Dissatisfaction is more likely when money is tighter, a 2022 study in the Journal of Consumer Research found. People feel worse about purchases of both things and experiences and write more negative reviews, researchers found. This regret often stems from thinking about all the other ways the money could have been used instead.⁠

⁠
Garment workers in Bangladesh make as little as $3 a day, or about $75 a month. In recent days, tens of thousands have refused to work, calling for the minimum wage to be raised to nearly three times that amount. Demonstrations have spiraled, with factories set ablaze and machines smashed. Some three hundred factories stopped operations.⁠
⁠
Sewing operator Hamim Shikder, who joined protests, said the roughly $125 a month he earns—after 50 hours of overtime—is spent on his son’s school fees, increasingly expensive groceries and other essentials. When his wife recently got sick with dengue he had to borrow money for medical bills. “Whatever amount I get, I have to spend,” he said.⁠
⁠
The core of the protests, that workers need higher wages to make even a basic living, has drawn widespread support, including from fashion giants H&M, Gap and Zara-parent Inditex, which source from the country. But no one can agree on who should foot the bill.⁠
⁠
Factory owners in Bangladesh say that for them to hike wages in a big way, Western brands that are their top buyers need to pay more for clothes. Although the big names in fashion publicly support higher pay, in practice they balk when costs go up and threaten to shift their orders to other countries, said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.⁠
⁠
Western brands say they support a boost in Bangladesh’s minimum wage, but most haven’t said by how much. Workers sewing clothes for them often make substantially more than the minimum wage but far less than what unions are demanding and what international organizations that benchmark living-wage standards consider to be enough.⁠

Most Asian and African migrants make multiple airport stopovers in what are coming to be known as “donkey flights” to reach countries such as Brazil, Ecuador or Nicaragua, which have few or no visa requirements for some nationalities. Once they set foot in Latin America, they move north in buses or cars and stay at hotels booked by smuggling organizations.⁠

For the second year in a row, arrests by the Border Patrol at the U.S. Southern border surpassed two million. Most of them, almost nine out of 10 apprehensions, are of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean.

But their parents, brothers and Jana’s husband, who aren’t U.S. citizens, were missing from the roster. “My husband said ‘Go save yourself and son—that’s the most important thing,’” recalls Jana, cradling her 3-month-old son in a hotel in Cairo, having left the rest of her family behind in Gaza.⁠

After a weekslong diplomatic wrangle to get the frontier open for foreign nationals and the injured, the task of choosing who goes through is arguably more arduous.⁠

An ambulance near the largest hospital in Gaza City was struck Friday by the Israelis, who said they were targeting Hamas militants using the vehicle. The border opened again on Monday.⁠

About 60 different nations have asked Egypt for around 7,600 foreign nationals—many of Palestinian heritage—to be allowed to leave Gaza, according to senior Egyptian officials.

WSJ,CzRTEiwM-we,2023-11-05 16:00:31,GraphImage,"Ittai Gradel, an academic–turned–gem dealer in Denmark, was trawling eBay a decade ago when he thought he had stumbled across a gold mine.⁠
⁠
Gradel saw a seller advertising a glass gem from the 19th century. Gradel immediately recognized it as something much more valuable: an agate Roman Medusa cameo from the second century. He snapped it up for £15 plus postage, then turned around and sold it to a collector for a couple of thousand pounds.⁠
⁠
In the following years, the same seller kept unearthing incredible finds at rock-bottom prices. Gradel inquired as to how he had come across these items. The seller said he had acquired them from his grandfather, who died in 1953. The oddly credible backstory left Gradel comfortable that he had encountered every dealer’s dream seller. ⁠
⁠
Then, in 2016, the seller posted a piece on eBay by mistake. Intrigued by the item, Gradel screenshotted it. But the seller quickly removed it from the website and said that it actually belonged to his sister, who didn’t want to sell it. ⁠
⁠
Gradel thought not much more about it. But in 2020, he came across an image on the British Museum’s website that showed the exact same item in its collection. Furthermore, the color photograph was recent. It suddenly dawned on Gradel: There was a thief in the British Museum. “And he was likely still within the walls,” he says.⁠
⁠
So began an antiques whodunit that has shaken the premise behind the museum’s most important reason for existing: that it is the best place to safely house some of the world’s greatest treasures. ⁠

WSJ,CzO8DogJSqZ,2023-11-04 18:00:47,GraphSidecar,"In the fall of 2021, a consultant named Arturo Bejar sent Meta Platforms Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg an unusual note.⁠
⁠
“I wanted to bring to your attention what l believe is a critical gap in how we as a company approach harm, and how the people we serve experience it,” he began. Though Meta regularly issued public reports suggesting that it was largely on top of safety issues on its platforms, he wrote, the company was deluding itself.⁠
⁠
The experience of young users on Meta’s Instagram—where Bejar had spent the previous two years working as a consultant—was especially acute. In a subsequent email to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, one statistic stood out: One in eight users under the age of 16 said they had experienced unwanted sexual advances on the platform over the previous seven days.⁠
⁠
For Bejar, that finding was hardly a surprise. His daughter and her friends had been receiving unsolicited penis pictures and other forms of harassment on the platform since the age of 14, he wrote, and Meta’s systems generally ignored their reports—or responded by saying that the harassment didn’t violate platform rules.⁠
⁠
“I asked her why boys keep doing that,” Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg and his top lieutenants. “She said if the only thing that happens is they get blocked, why wouldn’t they?”⁠
⁠
For the well-being of its users, Bejar argued, Meta needed to change course, focusing less on a flawed system of rules-based policing and more on addressing such bad experiences. ⁠
⁠
“I am appealing to you because I believe that working this way will require a culture shift,” Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg—the company would have to acknowledge that its existing approach to governing Facebook and Instagram wasn’t working.⁠
⁠
Two years later, the problems Bejar identified remain unresolved, and new blind spots have emerged. The company launched a sizable child-safety task force in June, following revelations that Instagram was cultivating connections among large-scale networks of pedophilic users, an issue the company says it’s working to address.⁠

WSJ,CzOhGFSuKLi,2023-11-04 14:05:42,GraphVideo,"Pozzuoli, a seaside town about 8 miles west of Naples, has had more than 2,500 earthquake tremors in the past three months. So far, few have been large, but residents are on edge: They live on top of a supervolcano, a classification given to about 20 of the world’s largest volcanoes. The constant earthquakes are a sign of volcanic activity deep underground.⁠
⁠
Vesuvius, southeast of Naples, which destroyed Pompeii in the first century A.D., is the region’s most famous volcano. But modern volcanologists are far more worried about the cluster of low-lying craters around Pozzuoli known as Campi Flegrei. The 80-square-mile depression is home to more than a dozen conical volcanoes, several crater lakes—and half a million residents. Another 800,000 people live just outside the depression.⁠
⁠
“It’s nonstop earthquakes here,” said Luca Averna, a part-time fisherman, during a recent 3.6-magnitude tremor. “We’re used to it, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t afraid.”⁠
⁠
In Campi Flegrei, like in Yellowstone and the world’s other supervolcanoes, the probability of a catastrophic eruption is low but not nil, said Alessandro Iannace, a geology professor at the University of Naples Federico II who wrote a popular geology book.⁠
⁠
“The difference is that in Yellowstone, if you think the eruption is coming, you can send the tourists home and close the park for four years,” said Iannace. “You can’t do that with Campi Flegrei. There are just too many people there.”⁠
⁠
An eruption in Campi Flegrei isn’t imminent, but earthquakes have weakened the volcano, making a rupture in the crust more likely, according to a recent study by researchers at Italy’s national institute and University College London.⁠

⁠
The 34-year-old, born Solána Rowe, has been churning out intimate, thorny, genre-blending hits about self-love and self-loathing since she signed to the rap label Top Dawg Entertainment in 2013.⁠
⁠
Her debut album, “Ctrl,” hasn’t left the Billboard 200 chart since July 2017. Her follow-up, “SOS,” dropped in December 2022; its 10 weeks on the chart made it the longest-running No. 1 album by a female artist of the decade. It also broke a record for most weeks atop the R&B chart.⁠
⁠
The five years between “Ctrl” and “SOS” elevated @sza to superstar status. She became more famous by being less present. Her fans are ravenous, rushing to stream her music and selling out dates on her first headline arena tour.⁠
⁠
Meanwhile, she’s obsessive about the music, and she takes every song personally. “I’ll die about that s—t every time,” she says. Everyone wants more songs, faster, now. SZA insists on taking her time.⁠
⁠
“When I leave the studio, I feel better and empty,” she says. “There’s no better sleep than empty-brain sleep, and that can only come after I’ve been in the studio for 10 hours and done something good in there.”⁠
⁠
Though her circuitous problems—love, heartbreak, ghosting, getting ghosted—have become signature subjects, she says she wants to write about the good stuff, too. “I go through so many other moments in life that are amazing, things that I could never describe,” she says. “I haven’t even tried to find words for those things.”⁠

⁠
Not quite business class and definitely not coach, premium-economy cabins are hooking travelers willing to treat themselves to extra comfort for about double the price of a coach seat on some flights.⁠
⁠
With offerings labeled Premium Plus, Premium Select or Premium Economy, airlines are expanding these sections, which typically come with roomy seats, early boarding, free alcohol and better meals. Airlines say they appeal to travelers with more disposable income, especially on long-haul flights where business-class seats can run thousands of dollars more.⁠
⁠
“I refer to it as an upper-middle cabin for the upper-middle class,” says Jay Sorensen, an industry consultant and president of IdeaWorksCompany. These sections appeal to travelers on work trips with budget-conscious employers, and vacationers who want some comforts without shelling out for business class.⁠
⁠
For flights to Europe from the U.S., round-trip tickets in the premium-economy cabin average about double the cost of main-cabin tickets, according to a fare analysis conducted by IdeaWorksCompany. Business-class seats on those routes are roughly double the cost of premium-economy seats, the analysis found.⁠

Travelers who do the math on upgrades say the decision depends on the costs, which can vary depending on demand and time of purchase. Customers also factor in flight length, whom they are traveling with and how much legroom they need. ⁠

Together, the colleagues feasted at Ramadan and lighted candles for Hanukkah. They visited one another’s homes and attended the weddings and funerals of their co-workers’ family members. Throughout past conflicts in the region, they have called their workplace an “island of peace.” ⁠

SodaStream’s presence in the region has put it in the middle of controversy over the years. A prior SodaStream factory, located in the West Bank, sparked calls for a boycott of the brand.⁠

The current factory is in the Negev Desert in southern Israel. The Gaza border is about 20 miles away. Before the Hamas terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, the SodaStream facility had about 1,500 employees, roughly a third of them Bedouin. More than 100 were Palestinians bused in every day from the West Bank. ⁠

Israeli tanks took up positions at the gates of Gaza City’s main hospital, the primary target in their battle to seize control of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, where medics said patients including newborns were dying for lack of fuel.
 
Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra, who was inside Al Shifa hospital, said 32 patients had died in the past three days, including three newborn babies, as a result of the siege of the hospital and lack of power.
 
At least 650 patients were still inside, desperate to be evacuated to another medical facility by the Red Cross or some other neutral agency. Israel says the hospital sits atop tunnels housing a headquarters for Hamas fighters using patients as shields, which Hamas denies.
 
Israel launched its campaign last month to annihilate Hamas, the militant group which runs the Gaza Strip, after Hamas fighters rampaged through southern Israel killing civilians. Around 1,200 people died and 240 were dragged to Gaza as hostages, according to Israel’s tally, in the deadliest day in its 75-year history.

Conservation group Forest and Bird announced that Oliver’s favored water bird, the pūteketeke, had won after Oliver went all-out in a humorous campaign for the bird on his HBO show “Last Week Tonight.”

The North Island brown kiwi came in second.
Usually billed Bird of the Year, the annual event is held to raise awareness about the plight of the nation’s native birds, some of which have been driven to extinction. This year, the contest was named Bird of the Century to mark the group’s centennial.

Oliver had discovered a loophole in the rules, which allowed anybody with a valid email address to cast a vote.

He had a billboard erected for “The Lord of the Wings” in New Zealand’s capital, Wellington, and put up billboards in Paris, Tokyo, London, and Mumbai, India.

The policy was issued by the court Monday. The justices, who have hinted at internal deliberations over an ethics code, last met Thursday in their private conference room at the court. The justices said in an unsigned statement that they have long adhered to ethics standards.

“The absence of a Code, however, has led in recent years to the misunderstanding that the Justices of this Court, unlike all other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules,” the justices wrote. “To dispel this misunderstanding, we are issuing this Code, which largely represents a codification of principles that we have long regarded as governing our conduct.”

The issue has vexed the court for several months, over a series of stories questioning the ethical practices of the justices. Many of those stories focused on Justice Clarence Thomas and his failure to disclose travel and other financial ties with wealthy conservative donors including Harlan Crow and the Koch brothers. But Justices Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor also have been under scrutiny.

Three justices, Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh, have voiced support for an ethics code in recent months. In May, Chief Justice John Roberts said there was more the court could do to “adhere to the highest ethical standards,” without providing any specifics.

⁠
Climate change is anticipated to only further the challenges producers are already seeing in two key beer crops, hops and barley. Some hops and barley growers in the U.S. say they’ve already seen their crops impacted by extreme heat, drought and unpredictable growing seasons.⁠
⁠
Researchers have known for a while that beer production will be affected by climate change, said Mirek Trnka, a professor at the Global Change Research Institute. He and his team recently authored a study modeling the effect of climate change on hops, out last month in Nature Communications, that projected that yields in Europe will decrease between four to 18% by 2050. His first study on hops 15 years ago issued a similar warning to his latest paper.⁠
⁠
That’s why some are working on varieties of hops that can better withstand summer heat, warmer winters, changing pests and diseases and less snowfall, which could mean less available irrigation, said Shaun Townsend, an associate professor and senior researcher at Oregon State University. Townsend is working on a project where he subjects hops to drought stress to eventually create more drought-tolerant varieties.⁠
⁠
It’s no easy task, one that can take a decade, and one that also has to take into account brewers’ main considerations, taste and yield. But the possibility of running out of water is a reality that’s on people’s radars, he said.⁠

Across the country, dazzling multi-colored lights decked homes and streets as devotees celebrated the annual Hindu festival of light symbolizing the victory of light over darkness.⁠
⁠
But the spectacular and much-awaited massive lighting of the oil lamps took place — as usual —at Saryu River, in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state, the birthplace of their most revered deity, the god Ram.⁠
⁠
At dusk on Saturday, devotees lit over 2.22 million lamps and kept them burning for 45 minutes as Hindu religious hymns filled the air at the banks of the river, setting a new world Record. Last year, over 1.5 million earthen lamps were lit.⁠
⁠
After counting the lamps, Guinness Book of World Records representatives presented a record certificate to the state’s top elected official Yogi Adityanath.⁠
⁠
Over 24,000 volunteers, mostly college students, helped prepare for the new record, said Pratibha Goyal, vice-chancellor of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, in Ayodhya.⁠
⁠
Diwali, a national holiday across India, is celebrated by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many light earthen oil lamps or candles, and fireworks are set off as part of the celebrations. In the evening, a special prayer is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring luck and prosperity.⁠
⁠
The festival came as worries about air quality in India rose. A “hazardous” 400-500 level was recorded on the air quality index last week, more than 10 times the global safety threshold, which can cause acute and chronic bronchitis and asthma attacks. But on Saturday, unexpected rain and a strong wind improved the levels to 220, according to the government-run Central Pollution Control Board.⁠

The photos were revealed by the European Space Agency, four months after the telescope launched from Cape Canaveral.

Although these celestial landscapes have been observed before by the Hubble Space Telescope and others, Euclid’s snapshots provide “razor-sharp astronomical images across such a large patch of the sky, and looking so far into the distant universe,” the agency said.

In one picture, Euclid captured a group shot of 1,000 galaxies in a cluster 240 million light-years away, against a backdrop of more than 100,000 galaxies billions of light-years away.

The telescope also snapped pictures of a relatively close spiral galaxy that is a ringer for our own Milky Way. Although the Hubble Space Telescope previously observed the heart of this galaxy, Euclid’s shot reveals star formation across the entire region, scientists said.

Walsh is currently serving five and half years in federal prison for stealing nearly $8 million in COVID-19 relief funds that he used, in part, to buy a Florida island.

While Walsh’s private island ranks among the more unusual purchases by pandemic fraudsters, his crime was not unique. He is one of thousands of thieves who perpetrated the greatest grift in U.S. history.

An AP review of hundreds of pandemic fraud cases presents a picture of thieves and scam artists who spent lavishly on houses, luxury watches and diamond jewelry, Lamborghinis and other expensive cars. The stolen aid also paid for long nights at strip clubs, gambling sprees in Las Vegas and bucket-list vacations.

Their crimes were relatively simple: The government’s goal was to get cash into the hands of struggling people and businesses with minimal hassle, particularly during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Safeguards to weed out the swindlers were dropped.

As Walsh’s case and thousands of others have shown, stealing the money was as easy as lying on an application.

About 700 are under construction at any one time, many on original lots. But just six of the town's 36 mobile home parks that served mostly low-income and older residents have reopened.⁠

Wildfires have always been a part of life in California, but they are getting more severe as climate change has caused hotter, drier summers. Seven of the state's top 10 most destructive fires happened in the past decade. Before the Camp Fire killed 85 people, the state’s deadliest was a 1933 blaze that killed 29. ⁠

Already, the Palestinian death toll passed 10,000 people, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Monday. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Some 1,400 Israelis have died, mostly civilians killed in the Oct. 7 incursion by Hamas that started the war.

The war has quickly become the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian violence since Israel’s establishment 75 years ago, with no end in sight as Israel vows to remove Hamas from power and crush its military capabilities.

Casualties are likely to rise sharply as the war turns to close urban combat. Troops are expected to enter Gaza City soon, Israeli media reported, and Palestinian militants who have had years to prepare are likely to fight street by street, launching ambushes from a vast network of tunnels.

Several hundred thousand people are believed to remain in the north in the assault’s path. The military says a one-way corridor for residents of Gaza City and surrounding areas to flee south remains available. But many are afraid to use the route, part of which is held by Israeli troops.

Around 70% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have fled their homes since the war began.

Keeping hundreds of sheep, of historically prized Churro and other breeds, used to be the norm for many families living on a vast reservation that straddles parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

But today some families have given up raising them all together. The ones who do report having far fewer sheep, sometimes just a handful. Still, many Navajo shepherds say they will keep their sheep as long as they can, and some younger people are speaking out and finding ways to pass on the tradition.

APNews,CzNGsUDtSOC,2023-11-04 00:55:14,GraphImage,"One of the pioneers of modern climate science is warning that the world isn’t just steadily warming but is dangerously accelerating, according to a study that some other scientists call a bit overheated.

The work from former NASA top scientist James Hansen, who since leaving the space agency has become a prominent protester against the use of fossil fuels, which cause climate change, illustrates a recently surfaced division among scientists about whether global warming has kicked into a new and even more dangerous gear.

Hansen, who alerted much of the United States to the harms of climate change in dramatic congressional testimony in 1988, said Thursday that since 2010, the rate of warming has jumped by 50%.

Hansen argues that since 2010 there is more sun energy in the atmosphere, and less of the particles that can reflect it back into space thanks to efforts to cut pollution. The loss of those particles means there’s less of the cooling effect that they can have.

Several climate scientists contacted by The Associated Press expressed skepticism about Hansen’s study, tinged with respect for his long-term work.

Hansen’s study in Thursday’s journal Oxford Open Climate Change is broad-ranging “but has little by way of analytical depth or consistency checks when making claims quite far outside the norm,” said Robin Lamboll, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London. “It seems primarily aimed at convincing policymakers rather than scientists.”

Ephron and Ryan were responsible for some of the culture’s most enduring and beloved modern romantic comedies from “When Harry Met Sally,” which Ephron wrote, to “Sleepless in Seattle” and “You’ve Got Mail.”

And this film was not just a romantic comedy, but one that Ryan co-wrote and directed too. She co-stars with David Duchovny in a kind of fairy tale about two exes stuck in an airport together for 24 hours during a snowstorm. Though it might sound slightly gimmicky on paper, the result is anything but — it’s smart, charming, a little whimsical and a very welcome return for Ryan, who hasn’t been in a film for eight years. It opens in theaters Friday.

“It’s hopefully a movie that just unzips you a little bit like in terms of your heart,” Ryan said. “It’s not a cynical movie at all. It’s vulnerable. But maybe around the holidays, people are more open to seeing movies like that.”

Ryan and Duchovny spoke with @apnewsentertainment about the film, Ryan’s hiatus, the false promise of fame and their kids following them into the business. Read more at the link in our bio.

“Now and Then” comes from the same batch of unreleased demos written by Lennon in the 1970s, which were given to his former bandmates by Yoko Ono. They used the tape to construct the songs “Free As a Bird” and “Real Love,” released in the mid-1990s. But there were technical limitations to finishing “Now and Then.”

On Wednesday, a short film titled “The Beatles — Now And Then — The Last Beatles Song” was released, detailing the creation of the track. On the original tape, Lennon’s voice was hidden; the piano was “hard to hear,” as Paul McCartney describes it. “And in those days, of course, we didn’t have the technology to do the separation.”

That changed in 2022, when the band — now a duo — was able to utilize the same technical restoration methods that separated the Beatles’ voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson’s 2021 documentary series, “The Beatles: Get Back.” And so, they were able to isolate Lennon’s voice from the original cassette and complete “Now and Then” using machine learning.
When the song was first announced in June, McCartney described artificial intelligence technology as “kind of scary but exciting,” adding: “We will just have to see where that leads.”

One picture is placed atop the other and fused to create a single image.

Lewiston won 34-18.

He sprinkles the crushed, colorful glass onto a template of his own design before baking the powder-coated pane at nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit for almost an entire day. Once cooled, a translucent, stained-glass image emerges.

“The light, with the glass, moves you to the core,” said Quagliata, an 81-year-old master of his craft, on a recent day at his studio in Valle de Bravo, near Mexico City. “It’s profound.”

Over the last five decades, Quagliata has created these stained-glass artworks for sacred spaces, private homes and public exhibitions, using a fusible glass technique he considers his most precious legacy.

The scope of Quagliata’s invention can be seen in “Holy Frit,” a documentary recently released in U.S. In the film, the Italian artist serves as a mentor-like figure for Tim Carey, a young American colleague who found himself facing the greatest challenge of his artistic career.

In 2015, Carey was appointed lead artist for a colossal project, a stained-glass window more than 90 feet long and nearly 40 feet high for a new church building in Leawood, Kansas. By 2017, “The Resurrection Window” would become the focal point in Resurrection’s sanctuary — the home base for the largest United Methodist congregation in the U.S.

Knight was among the winningest coaches in the sport, finishing his career with 902 victories in 42 seasons at Army, Indiana and Texas Tech. He also coached the U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in 1984.

The Hall of Famer cared little what others thought of him, choosing Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” to celebrate his 880th win in 2007, then the record for a Division I men’s coach.

He was nicknamed “The General” and his temper was such that in 2000 it cost him his job at Indiana. He once hit a police officer in Puerto Rico, threw a chair across the court and was accused of wrapping his hands around a player’s neck.

His critics fumed relentlessly about his conduct, but his defenders were legion. There was this side of Knight as well: He took pride in his players’ high graduation rates, and during a rule-breaking era he never was accused of a major NCAA violation.

Most years, the COP president plays a largely functionary role, shuttling between member countries to find common ground on wonky areas of climate policy. Al Jaber has taken a very different approach. 

He has extended an invitation to oil and gas companies and prioritized private-sector climate solutions. In Al Jaber’s view, the success of COP28, not to mention the broader efforts to fight climate change, hinges as much on embracing the private sector and shifting market conditions as it does on wonky negotiations. 

“There’s going to be a paradigm shift,” he says. 

Critics from Greta Thunberg to Al Gore say Al Jaber is just a stalking horse for the fossil-fuel industry’s continuing efforts to stall the global climate agenda. 

Al Jaber says he’s uniquely positioned to reconcile the many interests in the climate fight. That debate will define the coming COP summit.

“It may or may not work,” says John Kerry, President Biden’s climate envoy. “Some might call it an experiment to have an oil-and-gas-­producing entity host COP. That’s the big question.”

“Wake up!” Yanai says squarely. “Japan is not an advanced nation at all, because we have been in a dormant state for 30 years.”

His sobering pitch is that Japan’s economy is teetering on a precipice because of an unhealthy obsession with manufacturing, workers conditioned to corporate bloat, and a budget financed by soaring debt rather than tax receipts.

Yanai is putting his money where his mouth is and in March hiked the wages of his 8,400 or so employees in Japan by up to 40%. 

“That still is low; it should be much higher,” he confesses. 

He’s calling on Japan’s government to take similarly proactive measures such as raising interest rates and making sweeping regulatory changes to prevent the nation of 125 million from sleepwalking into disaster. 

Uniqlo’s agility and swelling global prominence runs counter to the diminishing imprint of many storied Japanese firms. Up until the 2000s, Japan teemed with engineering pioneers: Casio; Seiko; Fujifilm. But in recent years, complacency, conservative leadership, and fierce competition have seen Japanese brands fall behind.

Issue One put Ohio at the center of the nation’s abortion battle after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Tuesday’s victory for abortion rights means that the state’s proposed ban on abortions after about six weeks cannot go into effect. Now, abortions will be allowed until viability, which was the standard under Roe. (Abortions after that time could only be considered if the treating physician considers the abortion “necessary to protect the pregnant woman's life or health.”)

In office since 2009, after an earlier term from 1996 to 2001, she is the world’s longest-serving female head of government and credited with subduing both resurgent Islamists and a once meddlesome military. 

Hasina is determined to extend that run at the ballot box in January. “I am confident that my people are with me,” she says in an interview with TIME in September. “They’re my main strength.”

Few rebuttals are as stark as the 19 assassination attempts that Hasina has weathered over the years. In recent months, supporters of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have clashed with security forces, leading to hundreds of arrests, police vehicles and public buses set ablaze, and several people killed. 

Bangladesh has taken an authoritarian turn under Hasina’s Awami League party. The last two elections were condemned by the U.S., E.U. and others for significant irregularities, including stuffed ballot boxes and thousands of phantom voters. (She won 84% and 82% of the vote, respectively.) 

Meanwhile, BNP workers have been hit by a staggering 4 million legal cases, while independent journalists and civil society also complain of vindictive harassment. Critics say January’s vote is tantamount to a coronation and Hasina to a dictator.

While the arbitrary detention of asylum seekers and #refugees is a breach of international law, successive Australian governments have continued to detain refugees arbitrarily since a 2004 decision found it legal under Australian domestic law.⁠

.⁠
The spartan emergency room of the government-run Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya hospital in the Indian capital is crowded with children struggling to breathe.⁠
.⁠
Many have asthma or pneumonia, conditions that spike as air pollution peaks each winter in the megacity of 30 million people.⁠
.⁠
Delhi regularly ranks among the most polluted major cities on the planet, with a melange of factory and vehicle emissions exacerbated by seasonal agricultural fires.⁠
.⁠
“Wherever you see there is poisonous smog,” said Ayansh’s mother Julie Tiwari, 26, as she rocked the baby on her lap, attempting to calm him.⁠
.⁠
“I try to keep the doors and windows closed as much as possible. But it’s like breathing poison all the time. I feel so helpless,” she said, fighting back tears.⁠
.⁠
On Thursday, the level of PM2.5 particles – small enough to enter the bloodstream – topped 390 micrograms per cubic metre, according to monitoring firm IQAir. That’s more than 25 times the daily maximum recommended by the World Health Organization.⁠

The demand for Darjeeling tea in India has fallen due to the availability of cheaper alternatives from #Nepal and rising production costs, endangering the industry and the livelihoods of thousands of workers.⁠

The Darjeeling tea industry was started by the British in the mid-19th century and now has 87 tea gardens in India's West Bengal state.⁠

Tea experts attribute the falling production to a nearly 40% decline since gardens were converted to fully organic, severe labor shortages, and climate change.⁠

The premium quality tea caters mostly to international markets, but exports to Russia, Japan, Iran, the US, and European countries have declined in the past five years.⁠

.⁠
Commissioned by the Grand Admiral and built by renowned architect Mimar Sinan around 1530, the so-called “Tiled Bathhouse” was a pinnacle of architectural splendour and sophistication in the city, famous for its distinctive blue and white Iznik tiles.⁠
.⁠
The intervening centuries had not been kind to the long-forgotten marvel. As the Ottoman Empire gave way to the increasingly Westernised Turkey of the 18th and 19th centuries, sensibilities moved away from older traditions, such as hammams, causing many – including Cinili Hamam – to fall into disrepair.⁠
.⁠
Many of its fixtures – including its eponymous tiles – were stripped away to be sold to international museums and private collectors, leaving behind a hollow shell.⁠
.⁠
Now, after a long and ambitious 13-year restoration effort, this lost treasure has been revitalised through the efforts of the Marmara Group and is once more a place of cleansing and relaxation, but also one that reflects much of Turkey’s hidden history.⁠

.⁠
Some rock carvings had been sighted before but now there is a greater variety that will help researchers establish their origins, archaeologist Jaime de Santana Oliveira said this week.⁠

One area shows smooth grooves in the rock thought to be where Indigenous inhabitants once sharpened their arrows and spears long before Europeans arrived.⁠

“The engravings are prehistoric, or precolonial. We cannot date them exactly, but based on evidence of human occupation of the area, we believe they are about 1,000 to 2,000 years old,” Oliveira said.⁠
.⁠
The rocky point is called Ponto das Lajes on the north shore of the Amazon near where the Rio Negro and Solimoes rivers join.⁠
.⁠
Oliveira said the carvings were first seen there in 2010, but this year’s drought has been more severe, with the Rio Negro dropping 15 metres (49.2 feet) since July, exposing vast expanses of rocks and sand where there had been no beaches.⁠

On September 16, 1982, members of a far-right-wing Christian militia, Phalange Party, coordinated with Israeli forces to kill between 2,000 and 3,500 Muslim Lebanese and Palestinian civilians.⁠

Saab said during the carnage she heard her neighbours screaming but no gunshots. Most victims were butchered with knives.⁠

But residents of Sabra and Shatila say that what they lived through then does not compare with the shocking violence unfolding in #Gaza now.⁠ ⁠

His photographs are reminiscent of Renaissance or Baroque paintings and are often based on parables. Sexual tension is ever-present in Nes’ work, as he delves into complex explorations of homoeroticism. ⁠
⁠
“My staged photographs are oversized and often recall well-known scenes from Art History and Western Civilization combined with personal experiences based on my life as a gay youth growing up in a small town on the periphery of Israeli society,” said Nes.⁠
⁠
Even though soldiers are his most common subject, Nes’s photographs subvert the stereotype and tropes of the hyper-masculine, jingoistic Israeli soldier. “I allowed my subjects to be sensitive, childlike and anxious,” he says. ⁠
⁠
“Before starting work on the Soldiers series, I decided my subjects would never be in combat,” Nes has also said. “They would always be in between. They eat, sleep, take a piss, but they never fight. Still, death is always present, lingering. The sleeping soldiers on the bus look as if they may be dead, because, as I was working on these pieces, suicide bombers were blowing themselves up in buses.”",2553,49,True,True

From “The Un-Jews,” by Natan Sharansky and Gil Troy: “The anti-Zionists know exactly what they are doing, and what they are undoing. They are trying to disentangle Judaism from Jewish nationalism, the sense of Jewish peoplehood, while undoing decades of identity-building…these anti-Zionists join a long history of such un-Jews, who wormed their way deep into the tradition and tried to weaken Jewish identity ideologically from within by canceling a central pillar of contemporary Jewish identity, as part of what they imagine to be a wider commitment to world liberation.”

“I now know I suffered from a failure of imagination, both moral and practical. Under Hamas, Gaza wasn’t a place where extremists had resigned themselves to their own strange version of normality. Rather, it was an active launching pad for an insane utopia, for the vision of a purified world the group’s fighters carried out during their atrocious rampage on October 7,” writes Armin Rosen.
