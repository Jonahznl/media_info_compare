CyriDgzPor3,2023-10-22 00:00:15,GraphImage,"U.S. Department of Agriculture budget analyst Wayne Connelly braced for his boss to discover his office had been taken over by historical artifacts. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Connelly had quietly started amassing materials from the agency‚Äôs 160-plus-year history to revive a museum that had closed more than a century ago. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Its new location: Connelly‚Äôs office and that of his remotely working boss. His supervisor said he didn‚Äôt mind having his former desk occupied by an exhibit on botanical explorers, among others, earlier this year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Around seven months ago, Connelly, shown here, hung a sign in the hallway proclaiming ‚ÄúMuseum‚Äù in antique-looking font, inviting passersby to stop by his warren of rooms crammed with artifacts, photos, typed placards explaining the historical significance, framed newspaper articles and colorful prints covering every inch of available wall and desktop.‚Å†
‚Å†
At the time it was built in the 1930s, the USDA‚Äôs South Building was believed to be the largest office building in the world, with 4,500 rooms, 7 miles of corridors, 12 million bricks and 11,000 miles of structural steel, according to the General Services Administration. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Connelly, a 35-year veteran of the agency, wasn‚Äôt always combing through that labyrinth looking for historical finds. But during the pandemic, he returned to the office earlier than many others and began walking the empty halls. ‚Å†
‚Å†
He began doing more research into the history of the agency, founded in 1862 by then-President Abraham Lincoln to deepen agricultural research and disseminate information at a time when about half of all Americans lived on farms. ‚Å†
‚Å†
For roughly two years, Connelly has been on a mission to track down every interesting historical item still lurking in the thousands of rooms that make up the U.S. Agriculture Department. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The museum‚Äôs latest challenge is access. For now, visitors can only enter with a USDA employee, given the location.‚Å†

‚Å†
The Journal found hundreds of merchants offering the new drug, which is being developed by Eli Lilly and is called retatrutide. Most appear to be Chinese sellers shipping directly to U.S. consumers from sites such as Made-in-China.com. Some of the sites, including ones that appear to be based in the U.S., have marketed their products via posts on Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit. A handful have run paid ads on Instagram and Google. A fitness influencer has offered it for sale via his newsletter.‚Å†
‚Å†
Excitement over retatrutide jumped in June when Lilly reported Phase 2 trial results that showed the drug led to an average weight loss of up to 24% over 48 weeks. That could prove better than Lilly‚Äôs already-approved drug Mounjaro.‚Å†
‚Å†
In August, the Journal reported that more than 50 websites were selling knockoff semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in Ozempic and Mounjaro respectively. The Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to two websites for ‚Äúunlawful sale of unapproved and misbranded drugs‚Äù after the Journal‚Äôs article. One, GorillaHealing.com, no longer lists those two drugs on its website, but does offer retatrutide. Last week, three days after the warning letter was posted publicly, the top result in a Google search for ‚Äúbuy retatrutide‚Äù was a GorillaHealing.com ad.‚Å†
‚Å†
GorillaHealing.com didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as Google, LinkedIn and Reddit all said in statements that they removed advertisements or user posts that were flagged by the Journal, each citing internal policies.‚Å†

‚Å†
Sales of previously owned homes in 2023 are expected to dwindle to a rate not seen since at least 2011, when the U.S. population was smaller and the country was still recovering from one of the worst housing crises ever, according to many economist forecasts.‚Å†
‚Å†
Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real-estate brokerage Redfin, estimated that total existing-home sales in 2023 would amount to around 4.1 million, which would mark the smallest number of sales since about 2008, the year that Lehman Brothers collapsed and sparked the global financial crisis. Zhao said sales are unlikely to pick up much next year, with mortgage rates likely to remain at elevated levels. ‚Å†
‚Å†
This year‚Äôs housing slowdown is very different from the previous one, after the housing bubble of the early 2000s burst. Back then, the economy entered a deep recession and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure. ‚Å†
‚Å†
This time around, home sales have been slowing for more than a year because of rising borrowing costs, record-high home prices and a very limited inventory of homes for sale. ‚Å†
‚Å†
If existing-home sales for the full year end up even lower than expected at fewer than four million, that would mark the first drop below that level since 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors. ‚Å†

The U.S. assessment drew, in part, on communications intercepts and other intelligence gathered by the U.S., defense officials said.‚Å†

‚Å†
The order comes from the ‚ÄúChapitos,‚Äù the group led by the four sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaqu√≠n ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzm√°n, who transformed the Sinaloa cartel into a global empire managing the supply of narcotics, from Mexican heroin to Colombian cocaine and fentanyl made with precursors from Asia.‚Å†

‚Å†
The documents from Remington Arms‚Äîwhich was part of a firearms conglomerate called Freedom Group‚Äîare being disclosed by a lawyer who obtained them in a lawsuit filed by parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Last year they settled with Remington, which made the AR-15 used by the killer, for $73 million. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Digital replicas of real guns have appeared in numerous videogames, and executives from both industries have acknowledged they signed partnerships for that purpose. But they haven‚Äôt disclosed the details of such deals or discussed the motivations behind them.‚Å†
‚Å†
The documents, from the late 2000s and early 2010s, show Remington and Freedom Group officials pursued deals to place their guns in shooter videogames as part of a marketing push for new audiences because they were concerned their customer base was aging.‚Å†
‚Å†
Executives at the gun giant, which was owned by private-equity company Cerberus and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, believed such deals would ‚Äúhelp create brand preference among the next generation,‚Äù and allow the company to ‚Äúwin our fair-share of these young consumers,‚Äù according to an undated Freedom Group memo titled ‚ÄúGaming Strategy.‚Äù‚Å†

Gradually you discover millions of people across the U.S. are in the same situation‚Äìone that will bring months or years of rebuilding. A gigantic solar storm has hit Earth. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The odds are low that in any given year a storm big enough to cause effects this widespread will happen. And the severity of those impacts will depend on many factors, including the state of our planet‚Äôs magnetic field on that day. But it‚Äôs a near certainty that some form of this catastrophe will happen someday, says Ian Cohen, a chief scientist who studies heliophysics at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.‚Å†
‚Å†
To get ahead of this threat, a loose federation of U.S. and international government agencies, and hundreds of scientists affiliated with those bodies, have begun working on how to make predictions about what our Sun might do. And a small but growing cadre of scientists argue that artificial intelligence will be an essential component of efforts to give us advance notice of such a storm.‚Å†
‚Å†
The most dangerous of these solar storms is known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME, when a gargantuan blob of charged particles is catapulted from the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere by rapidly shifting magnetic fields, at speeds in excess of 8,000 times that of sound. These happen often, but we‚Äôre rarely aware of them because they only affect us when they happen to strike earth.‚Å†
‚Å†
Satellites that orbit high above Earth in so-called geostationary orbit would be the first to feel the effects. In theory, they can be incapacitated by ‚Äúkiller electrons‚Äù more common during certain kinds of solar storms. The electrons can penetrate satellites, and the resulting charge can build up, damaging electronics. Losing these satellites could cause worldwide disruption of GPS services.‚Å†

‚Å†
Although rents are still generally higher than they were prepandemic, local real-estate agents said the velocity of people moving to Miami has slowed and there are fewer people willing to overpay. Meanwhile, newly built apartments are adding thousands of rental units to the market, further easing the supply-demand imbalance that has characterized the market over the past few years.‚Å†
‚Å†
In the Miami luxury market, defined as the top 10% of the market, nearly all segments are down from pandemic-era peaks, said local real-estate agent Ana Bozovic, whose firm Analytics.Miami tracks the market. ‚Å†

So far this year, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom house in Miami-Dade County is $8,500, down 15% from $10,000 last year, she said. For condos, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom is $8,200, down 8.9% from $9,000 last year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Overall, Miami‚Äôs rental market seems to be cooling faster than other cities nationwide, according to data from listing website Zumper.

Everything Sally had to do to prepare ran through his head: tell his girlfriend; notify his boss; arrange for someone to watch his house and his rescue pitbull, Athena; connect with his commanding officer in Israel; procure the appropriate gear; and, perhaps most daunting, find a way to get from the bright lights of Sin City to a war zone in the Middle East.‚Å†

‚Å†
Studies show that workers value the freedom and flexibility of remote work, in some cases more than a pay raise.‚Å†

Hamas fighters on the ground explicitly targeted Israeli civilians for killing. Israelis were shot while driving along the street. They were pulled from their homes and killed. Hamas carried out the mass murder of some 260 people at the Tribe of Nova music festival.

Vladimir Putin, a purported friend of Israel, has said little, other than blaming a failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East. No surprise there. What Hamas did to the Israelis is what Putin has been doing to civilians in Ukraine for almost two years.

Since the February 2022 invasion, it is estimated that about 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. Russia has killed hundreds with missiles fired into residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns. It has targeted schools, hospitals and food markets.

These civilian deaths‚Äîby Hamas in Israel and Russia in Ukraine‚Äîare not collateral damage from urban warfare. They are part of the war plan, thought out by calm men sitting around a table, in Moscow or Beirut, looking at maps and civilian targets. Crimes against humanity are becoming normalized.

Our adversaries‚ÄîRussia, Iran, China and North Korea‚Äîwill continue the mass killing of civilians and hostage-taking as a strategic policy until the U.S. decisively counters this awful new normal.

‚Å†
Houston, Dallas and Austin top the list of major U.S. cities with the highest office-vacancy rates, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics. About 25% of their office space wasn‚Äôt leased as of the third quarter. That was more than double New York‚Äôs vacancy rate of 12% and well above San Francisco‚Äôs vacancy rate of 17%.‚Å†
‚Å†
Texas office floors are struggling to find tenants even though the state‚Äôs workers have been more eager to get back to the office than in most other places. According to Kastle Systems, which measures occupancy by counting keycard swipes in 10 major metro areas, Houston, Austin and Dallas have the highest office-return rates.‚Å†
‚Å†
Vacancies are high largely because Texas developers build too much. All three cities experienced a surge in construction in the 1980s, when tax rules favored developers and loose lending created a commercial real-estate bubble. Another construction spurt in the late 1990s aggravated the problem.‚Å†
‚Å†
Texas‚Äô high vacancy rate offers more evidence that the U.S. office market‚Äôs biggest problem hasn‚Äôt been primarily remote work.

The younger Arnault is learning the ropes of his father‚Äôs luxury‚Äôs empire, and Louis Vuitton has bet on the 24-year-old to turn the brand into a player in high-end, mechanical watchmaking.‚Å†
‚Å†
Jean was standing in a gilded, mirrored room of Paris‚Äôs Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay showing off Louis Vuitton‚Äôs newest watch model to a clutch of experts one July morning. The thin unisex watch, named the Tambour, was the result of almost two years of work. But the most valuable Tambour in the building wasn‚Äôt on display with the others. It was on Arnault‚Äôs wrist.‚Å†
‚Å†
His version was made of the rare metal tantalum. Tantalum gave the watch its gunmetal color, though the metal‚Äôs hardness also meant that the watch took twice as much time to manufacture. This made it ‚Äúinsanely expensive‚Äù when he bought it, Arnault said, though he refused to reveal what he paid.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only going to make one,‚Äù Arnault said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs the only one.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
Two years ago, when he first joined Louis Vuitton‚Äôs watches division as market ing and development director, Louis Vuitton watches ran a wide gamut. They ranged from watches costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to quartz timepieces that sold for around $4,000.‚Å†
‚Å†
Now Arnault has decided to eliminate the entry-level Tambours. His thinking was that instead of producing more affordable collections, Louis Vuitton needed to play in a different class.

The phenomenon has become something of an internet debate, with some people speculating that weight loss on European sojourns points to unhealthy American diets and processed foods.‚Å†
‚Å†
So what‚Äôs the real answer? Alas, there‚Äôs no definitive explanation. You might be surprised (or not!) to find out that research on vacation is scant.‚Å†
‚Å†
Scientists who study nutrition and health say that people who lose weight on international travels are likely benefiting from two things: more daily steps while on vacation and, yes, food that is often healthier and less processed.‚Å†
‚Å†
Ultra-processed foods common in the U.S. include artificial additives and highly refined ingredients and are rich in starch, sugar and salt, says Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of nutrition and medicine at Tufts University. He points to a study in the European Journal of Nutrition that found that among adults in the U.S., 57% of calories come from ultra-processed food, compared with 12% in Europe.‚Å†
‚Å†
What‚Äôs more, portion sizes tend to be larger in the U.S., and people drink more sodas and sugar-sweetened beverages, food researchers say. And Europeans often eat in a more leisurely way that is less prone to overeating, they note.‚Å†

Penn demoted Katalin Karik√≥, shunting her to a lab on the outskirts of campus while cutting her pay.

CyBXoZ-R0ab,2023-10-05 15:01:18,GraphImage,"Ecuadoreans and foreigners alike have had to dramatically alter their way of life as a country that had been known for its natural beauty and relative safety quickly turned into one of the world‚Äôs most violent. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Bobbi de Winter had found her retirement paradise on Ecuador‚Äôs coast, where tiny red crabs scuttle across pristine beaches, giant sea turtles lay their eggs and whales breach the warm Pacific waters.‚Å†
‚Å†
De Winter, a native of Atlanta, and her husband, Andre, had recently finished building a house overlooking the Pacific, accessible by crossing a lush forest. They set up hammocks, planted banana and papaya trees, and hosted dinner parties as the sun set over the ocean. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Then came the drug gangs and horrific violence. Killings marred the once-sleepy district where they live, De Winter said, recalling how her husband once had to swerve his car to avoid a man who‚Äôd been shot in the street. A month after the De Winters finished their house, police found millions of dollars in cocaine stashed at a nearby beach, drugs that officers said were to be trafficked north on high-powered boats. A presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, was gunned down in August. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Worried about Ecuador‚Äôs deteriorating security, the De Winters now intend to sell. ‚ÄúI had to let go of my dream,‚Äù said De Winter. ‚Å†
‚Å†
This year, Ecuador is on track to top 7,000 killings, seven times the number in 2018, government data shows.‚Å†
‚Å†
Driving the carnage is the country‚Äôs transformation into a transshipment hub for drugs from neighboring Colombia, where cocaine production hit a record high. The disarmament of Colombian drug-trafficking guerrillas in 2016 led to a power vacuum as other gangs battled to take over the routes into Ecuador, with its hundreds of miles of unguarded coast. ‚Å†

‚Å†
Interest rates are up. Inflation remains high. Pandemic savings have shrunk. And the labor market is cooling.‚Å†
‚Å†
Yet household spending, the primary driver of the nation‚Äôs economic growth, remains robust. Americans spent 5.8% more in August than a year earlier, well outstripping less than 4% inflation. And the experience economy boomed this summer, with Delta Air Lines reporting record revenue in the second quarter and Ticketmaster selling over 295 million event tickets in the first six months of 2023, up nearly 18% year-over-year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Economists and financial advisers say consumers putting short-term needs and goals above long-term ones is normal. Still, this moment is different, they say.‚Å†
‚Å†
A tough housing market has more consumers writing off something they‚Äôd historically save for, while the pandemic showed the instability of any long-term plans related to health, work or day-to-day life. So, they are spending on once-in-a-lifetime experiences because they worry they may not be able to do them later.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a regret-filled, spur-of-the-moment decision,‚Äù says Michael Liersch, who oversees a team of advisers as head of advice at Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the opposite of that, where I would regret not having done it.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
Consumers might not be able to keep splurging forever. Labor strikes and student loan repayments could both lead people to pull back. Rising gas prices could also deter travel.‚Å†

‚Å†
Made from rigid plastic foam, plumbing and scrap equipment, the gear is produced based on the logic that every Russian missile, shell or drone used to strike them is one fewer targeting real equipment and troops. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Replicas likely account for at least some of the weapons Russia claims to have destroyed on the battlefield, which exceed the numbers in Ukraine‚Äôs arsenal.‚Å†
‚Å†
Decoys can help mislead an enemy about attack plans or fool an opponent into believing that an area is better defended than it really is, deterring an assault. Deception has been an important tool of warfare throughout history, but the war in Ukraine has presented new challenges. Advances in thermal imaging can reveal targets that are invisible to the naked eye, or expose fakes as inert dummies. Inexpensive drones offer armies pervasive real-time surveillance, which complicates longstanding approaches to assembling or inflating replicas.‚Å†
‚Å†
Combatants say that with everything on a battlefield potentially observed, deception becomes more difficult‚Äîand more critical.‚Å†

‚Å†
Many emergency doctors don‚Äôt treat enough children to be able to spot life-threatening illnesses obscured by run-of-the-mill symptoms, or conditions more common in kids. Some E.R. staff default to drug doses and protocols meant for adults and either don‚Äôt have or don‚Äôt know where to find child-size gear in a crisis.‚Å†
‚Å†
Matthew Melancon, pictured here on the left, and Avery Guzman-Mendez, on the right, died 20 years apart after being treated at the same emergency room in Texas that was unable to successfully intubate them. The hospital, Ascension Seton Highland Lakes, hasn‚Äôt been certified under a Texas program that recognizes facilities working to upgrade their crisis care for kids.‚Å†
‚Å†
Avery‚Äôs family settled a lawsuit against the hospital earlier this year. Terms weren‚Äôt disclosed. Ascension, the health system that owns Highland Lakes, didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment, but in court records issued a blanket denial of all the lawsuit‚Äôs allegations.‚Å†
‚Å†
Doctors, health authorities and policy makers have known‚Äîand warned‚Äîof unpreparedness for decades. Research in recent years has quantified the lack of readiness and number of child deaths that could have been avoided, and pointed to basic steps for solving the problem.‚Å†

Telling the truth can spark change, make your work life better and show off your own assertiveness. Or you could get fired. (At least it feels that way.)‚Å†
‚Å†
Like it or not, silence isn‚Äôt an option. But you have to be really careful about just how candid to get with the boss.‚Å†
‚Å†
The average person lies three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting someone new, according to research from Robert Feldman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Such superficial fibs lubricate many of our social interactions, he says, helping us fit in and getting people to like us. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúAt the end of the day, we want to hear good things,‚Äù Feldman says. ‚ÄúYour boss is just like everybody else.""‚Å†
‚Å†
What about when bosses want to be tapped into what‚Äôs really going on, too? After all, you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs connected to collegial chatter and gossip, which can give managers insight into how they can do a better job and get ahead. Giving the right information to your boss can help you, too. You just have to share it the right way.‚Å†
‚Å†
A smart start is to ask some questions of your own to the boss, says Matt Abrahams, who teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. What kind of guidance do they typically find useful? If they readily divulge a time they messed up or made a change, be more candid, he suggests.‚Å†

‚Å†
Vacancy rates are soaring and companies are competing to unload space in the sublease market. Office values and rents are falling. Developers are delaying new office projects, while office defaults are mounting.‚Å†
‚Å†
Atlanta‚Äôs commercial-property turmoil shows that even Sunbelt cities with thriving economies can‚Äôt escape the office-sector meltdown.

‚Å†
Later this year, though, the three pandas living in the National Zoo will be sent to China, which has the rights to pandas in captivity all over the world. The departure of Tian Tian, a 26-year-old male, Mei Xiang, a 25-year-old female and their three-year old cub, Xiao Qi Ji, will leave Washington without at least one of the rotund, cuddly-looking bears for only the second time since Richard Nixon‚Äôs breakthrough with Beijing in 1972.‚Å†
