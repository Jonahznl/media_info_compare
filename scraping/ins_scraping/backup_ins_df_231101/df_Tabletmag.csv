Rather, it was an active launching pad for an insane utopia, for the vision of a purified world the group’s fighters carried out during their atrocious rampage on October 7,” writes Armin Rosen.

They particularly relished targeting women—slaughtering them, raping them, cutting babies out of pregnant women’s wombs, torturing mothers and grandmothers in front of their families—and, many fear, sexually enslaving some of the hostages. The world witnessed these perversions because the villains proudly filmed them.

Tunisia once boasted a Jewish community of 100,000. By 1967, Jews began fleeing a wave of anti-Jewish attacks en masse. 40,000 of them went to Israel. 

With the Tunisian revolution in 2011, anti-Jewish sentiment began sweeping the country again. Soon after the revolution, a Hamas leader visited Tunis and, upon arrival at the airport, shouted, “Kill the Jews!” A couple of months after that incident, a crowd of Salafi Muslims gathered in front of Tunis’s Grand Synagogue shouting anti-Jewish slogans, led by a cleric who urged Muslims to “rise up and wage a war against the Jews.”

The El-Hamma tomb site of Rabbi Yosef Ma’aravi (pictured here) was also ransacked in 2011. El-Hamma no longer has a Jewish community. However, pilgrimages to Rabbi Yosef Ma’arabi tomb occur on an annual basis during the day of the month of Teveth.
