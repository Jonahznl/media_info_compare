If it’s about Republican Candidate Ron DeSantis wearing heels, you’re in luck. On a recent segment of Fox News, host Jesse Watters sent his team to investigate if the Florida governor wears shoe lifts or heels to look taller. 

The latest polls have remained consistent with those weeks before: in the GOP presidential race, DeSantis remains far behind Donald Trump despite facing multiple criminal charges. 

Many Floridians are also calling out DeSantis for neglecting his governor role to campaign as the state faces a mass exodus of migrant workers due to his policies.

The former president of the Spanish soccer federation vowed to appeal the ruling, which he called “disproportionate and unjust” in a post on X. 

The incident sparked massive backlash, triggering weeks of protests. Despite widespread calls for Rubiales to resign, he initially refused, claiming the unwanted kiss was “mutual” and that he was the victim of a “witch hunt.” 
Hermoso has repeatedly stated the kiss was not consensual, and said she felt “vulnerable and a victim of aggression.” 

More than 80 Spanish soccer players, including the majority of the World Cup winning team, signed a statement in support of Hermoso, demanding structural changes and saying they would not play for the national team “if current leaders continue.” 

After Rubiales denied that the kiss was unwanted in front of a judge in Madrid during a court hearing on September 15, the judge issued him a restraining order and prohibited him from contacting Hermoso. 

Spain’s high court is currently investigating a complaint filed by prosecutors that there could be grounds to investigate Rubiales for sexual assault and coercion.

On Friday October 20 the Israeli Defence Forces said more than 20 children were among the hostages. It said it believed “the majority” of hostages were still alive.

Among those believed to be captives in Gaza are festival-attendees, children, elderly people and soldiers.

Many families have spoken out to raise awareness about their missing loved ones, while the identities of many of the hostages have not been revealed.

Many of the hostages have dual citizenship or are foreigners. The US, Germany, Thailand, Mexico, Brazil, Nepal and the UK have all reported that their citizens are missing, kidnapped, or killed.

The United States has sent a team of Special Operations forces to Israel to help with intelligence to locate the hostages, while Qatar has served as a mediator in the negotiations between Hamas, Israel, and Israel’s allies.

A ground operation into the densely populated Gaza strip to rescue the hostages could risk the lives of both those being held captive and the military, according to US and Israeli military sources. Israel believes the hostages are being held in tunnel systems beneath Gaza created by Hamas, which means it is difficult to determine their location, and they could potentially be moved.

The historic drought has impacted an estimated 481,000 people as of Monday October 16, according to the civil defense agency in Amazonas state. 

The port of Manaus, where the Rio Negro and Amazon River meet, recorded water levels of just 13.59 meters (44.6 feet) on October 16, the lowest since records began in 1902. 

The drought has contributed to thousands of wildfires, leaving the city of Manaus, the Amazonas state capital home to one million people, with the second worst air quality in the world. 

Amazonas recorded 2,770 wildfires so far this dry season, the highest ever recorded according to local media. 

Travelling by river is often the only way to reach remote areas of the Amazon, and as water levels drop some jungle communities have been cut off and are unable to access food, medicine and water supplies. 

Nelson Mendonca, a community leader in Santa Helena do Ingles, told Reuters that while canoes can still transport goods to some remote communities, many supplies have been carried on foot or by tractor. 

“It’s not very good for us, because we’re practically isolated,” he said.

At least 100 endangered pink river dolphins have also died in recent weeks, likely due to the drought and high water temperature.

Ghassan Abu Sitta, a doctor associated with Doctors Without Borders, described the events that unfolded inside Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital on the evening of Tuesday October 17. 

“We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion, and the ceiling fell on the operating room. This is a massacre,” he said. 

Palestinian health officials in Gaza, governed by Hamas since 2007, said 500 people were killed when an Israeli air strike hit the hospital. If the death-toll is confirmed, it would be the biggest single loss of loss in all five wars between Hamas and Israel since 2007.

Israel has denied striking the hospital, saying that the blast was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants from a cemetery near the hospital. During a visit to Israel on Wednesday and sitting alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Joe Biden said: ""Based on what I've seen it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But there's a lot of people out there who are not sure, so we've got to overcome a lot of things.”

Israel has been warning the entire world that it was going to attack Palestinian hospitals and it did exactly that,” he said. “Every western politician who has declared unconditional support for Israel's war on the Palestinian people has the blood of these children on their hands.”

The World Health Organisation said it “strongly condemns” the attack. “We call for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, and for the evacuation orders to be reversed.”

The International Committee of the Red Cross said: “We are shocked and horrified by reports that Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza was destroyed and hundreds were killed. Hospitals should be sanctuaries to preserve human life, not scenes of death and destruction. No patient should be killed in a hospital bed. No doctors should lose their lives while trying to save others. Hospitals must be protected under international humanitarian law.”

The rights group said that it verified footage taken in Lebanon on Tuesday and in Gaza on Wednesday showing multiple instances of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port, and at two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.

The use of white phosphorus – which burns when exposed to oxygen, creating intense heat and smoke – is not banned outright in warzones under international law. The substance can be legally used on battlefields for marking targets or creating smoke screens.

But its use near civilians is prohibited under Protocol III of the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons – although Israel has not signed the convention and is therefore not bound by it.

Human Rights Watch said the use of the white phosphorus in Gaza, one of the world’s most densely populated areas, violated the prohibitions in international humanitarian law against putting civilians at unnecessary risk.

“Any time that white phosphorus is used in crowded civilian areas, it poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering,” said Lama Fakih, the group’s Middle East and North Africa director. “White phosphorus is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and cause egregious harm to civilians.”

The group said Israel should ban the use of “airburst” white phosphorus munitions in populated areas, adding that there were non-lethal alternatives.

Human Rights Watch said that as well as verifying a video of the use of airburst 155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles above Gaza City, it had interviewed two witnesses in the city who had described seeing and smelling phenomena consistent with white phosphorus.

In response to the report, Israel's military told Reuters that it was “currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza,” and did not address questions around their alleged use in Lebanon. #israel #lebanon #palestine #gaza",61917,3018

The United Nations asked Israel to rescind the order, saying it would be “impossible” for the 1.1 million people who live in the area to leave their homes in that timeframe “without devastating humanitarian consequences.”

The Israeli Defence Forces said the evacuation order was for the safety of Palestinian civilians, while Hamas told Palestinians to ignore the order, saying it amounted to “fake propaganda.”

Around 2.3 million people live in Gaza, a thin coastal strip that is one of the world’s most densely-populated areas. It has been governed  since 2007 by Hamas, the Islamist group designated as a terror organisation by the US, UK and EU, whose fighters launched an unprecedented assault upon Israel last Saturday, October 7.

After storming out of Gaza, Hamas militants carried out a series of massacres against civilians including children and babies at villages, kibbutzim, towns and a music festival. More than 1,300 people were killed in the attacks, including 247 soldiers. At least 100 hostages were taken into Gaza, while Israel said 1,500 Hamas militants were killed.

Israel’s government vowed to destroy Hamas in response. It launched a devastating barrage of air strikes against Gaza, killing more than 1,500 people, and imposed what it called a “total siege” by cutting off supplies of fuel, electricity, food and water.

Under blockade since 2007, Gaza has been described as the world’s biggest open-air prison. An already dire humanitarian situation has been dramatically worsened by the strikes and siege.

Gaza’s only power station shut down on Wednesday, while hospitals are running out of medicine and medical supplies, as well as space to store bodies.

International journalists from outlets including the BBC and the New York Times were on Tuesday taken around Kfar Aza, just a few miles away from the border fence where Hamas gunmen broke through from Gaza, launching multiple attacks against kibbutzim – a type of collective farm –, villages, and a music festival where 260 bodies were recovered, as well as military targets.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said fighting in the area around Kfar Aza was ongoing until Tuesday morning. Troops were only now able to recover the bodies of civilians from homes that they said had been booby-trapped after Hamas fighters had gone house-to-house shooting civilians.

Major General Itai Veruv, who was officially retired until this week, described what took place in the kibbutz as a “massacre.”

“It’s not a war, it’s not a battlefield, it’s a massacre,” he said. “It’s something that I never saw in my life.”

In a separate video update posted online, IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus likened the situation at Kfar Aza to “something out of a scene of an apocalyptic movie, or something related to zombies.”

This comes just three years after the government launched an anti-bed bug campaign complete with a website and hotline when they noticed an uptick in the number of troublesome bugs.",33187,1295

A man named Robin Gunningham, previously identified as Banksy, has been named as the first defendant in a defamation legal action at London’s High Court.

His co-defendant is the company Banksy established, Pest Control Ltd.

UK newspaper the Mail on Sunday first claimed that Banksy is Gunningham back in 2008. According to the Sunday Times, Gunningham began using the name Robin Banks, which eventually became Banksy.

Celebrities such as Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and George Michael have spent huge sums on Banksy’s  artwork. His “Love is in the Bin” piece sold for £18.5 million at auction in 2021. 

Banksy and Pest Control have not commented on the legal action.",17859,295
vicenews,Cx56DIDOXCN,2023-10-02 17:28:39,GraphVideo,"A young man falsely accused of being a federal agent posing as a neo-Nazi by Elon Musk and a bunch of other right-wing trolls has launched a lawsuit against the one-time richest man in the world.

Earlier this year, college student Ben Brody, 22, had his life turned upside down when he was accused of being a part of a Pacific Northwest neo-Nazi group. The claims occurred after a neo-Nazi had his mask pulled off when his group had a small brawl with local Proud Boys in Oregon City on June 24.

The unmasked neo-Nazi bore a passing resemblance to Brody, who once wrote on a website for his Jewish fraternity that he wanted to work for the government.

According to the lawsuit, and in an interview with VICE News at the time of the incident, Brody suffered a “severe degree of mental stress, anguish, fear, personal embarrassment, and psychological harm which disrupted his daily life,” and worried that being publicly connected to a neo-Nazi group will impact his future employment.

“The reality is that too many powerful people with enormous audiences are being reckless with their accusations against private people,” reads the lawsuit against Musk. “The damage they cause is not easily repaired by apologies or counter-speech, no matter how persuasive. Repair of reputations, compensation for harm, and effective deterrence can only occur in our courts.”

The young man is being represented by Mark Bankston, a lawyer who last year successfully sued Alex Jones for $49 million on behalf of the parents of children killed in Sandy Hook.",13441,559

But it wasn’t only electric vehicles that caught his rage. Trump targeted president Joe Biden’s administration before going on a nearly 20-minute rant against Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who is also in the Republican primary race for a 2024 presidential nomination. 

Trump talks about sharks surprisingly frequently. In 2011, adult film star Stormy Daniels – who said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 – gave an interview in which she said Trump is “obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks.”

In tweets posted in 2013, Trump wrote that he was “just not a fan of sharks” and that they were “last on my list - other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World!”

And in a speech at an event in 2023, Trump said: “They were saying the other night, the shark. They were saying, ‘Sharks, we have to protect them.’ I said, ‘Wait a minute, wait.’ They actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark. I said, ‘Wait, don’t you have it the other way around?’”",7341,1172

But despite being internet famous, the creature, along with owner Joie Henney were denied entry into a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game.

Initially, Henney told the media that he and Wally had been invited to meet the Phillies players ahead of the game who just clinched a wild-card playoff spot. But they arrived late, and missed the opportunity. 

So they went to buy tickets but were denied entry to Philadelphia's Citizen Bank Park due to a stadium rule that only allowed certified service dogs in. Henney told CNN that he and his reptile friend were allowed into other stadiums for baseball games before, and that he’s even seen emotional support horses at some events.

Now, Henney still has hopes that Wally will still get a chance to meet the Phillies players to give them good luck and support as MLB goes into the postseason.

Wally is a regular fixture of local community events and birthdays, with Instagram posts showing him swimming in pools with kids as well as giving people hugs.",11659,242
