Time,Czqus1COb_X,2023-11-15 13:02:51,GraphImage,"As the head of both COP28 and one of the world's largest fossil fuel companies, Sultan Al Jaber is in the middle of the climate fight.

Most years, the COP president plays a largely functionary role, shuttling between member countries to find common ground on wonky areas of climate policy. Al Jaber has taken a very different approach. 

He has extended an invitation to oil and gas companies and prioritized private-sector climate solutions. In Al Jaber’s view, the success of COP28, not to mention the broader efforts to fight climate change, hinges as much on embracing the private sector and shifting market conditions as it does on wonky negotiations. 

“There’s going to be a paradigm shift,” he says. 

Critics from Greta Thunberg to Al Gore say Al Jaber is just a stalking horse for the fossil-fuel industry’s continuing efforts to stall the global climate agenda. 

Al Jaber says he’s uniquely positioned to reconcile the many interests in the climate fight. That debate will define the coming COP summit.

“It may or may not work,” says John Kerry, President Biden’s climate envoy. “Some might call it an experiment to have an oil-and-gas-­producing entity host COP. That’s the big question.”

Time,CzTjwwgOI-4,2023-11-06 13:04:43,GraphImage,"Within minutes of the Oct. 31 Israeli attack on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, the victims began flooding the Indonesian Hospital a mile away. Dr. Marwan Sultan, the hospital’s medical director, says that most of the injured and dead were women and children.

There are only 16 intensive-­care beds in the hospital, which was running dangerously low on fuel; the doctor had enough to perform lifesaving operations until the end of the day. 

“If the electricity goes,” says Sultan, “they will die. They will die.” 

All war zones are awful, but Gaza presents a unique hell. Much of the enclave of 2 million is now a battlefield, with civilians and combatants intermixed, and homes and businesses sitting side by side with Hamas military infrastructure. 

Nowhere is that reality felt more keenly than at the territory’s hospitals, which have simultaneously become safe havens and potential targets.

The conditions for medical care in Gaza are deteriorating. Surgeons are operating by flashlight and rationing water, anesthesia, and the generator fuel needed to perform surgeries, provide electricity for incubators, and care for kidney-dialysis patients, doctors and health organizations tell TIME. The roughly two dozen hospitals still operating in Gaza are absorbing the patients of the 12 that have closed because of a lack of supplies and the ongoing bombing, says the World Health Organization (WHO).

“Wake up!” Yanai says squarely. “Japan is not an advanced nation at all, because we have been in a dormant state for 30 years.”

His sobering pitch is that Japan’s economy is teetering on a precipice because of an unhealthy obsession with manufacturing, workers conditioned to corporate bloat, and a budget financed by soaring debt rather than tax receipts.

Yanai is putting his money where his mouth is and in March hiked the wages of his 8,400 or so employees in Japan by up to 40%. 

“That still is low; it should be much higher,” he confesses. 

He’s calling on Japan’s government to take similarly proactive measures such as raising interest rates and making sweeping regulatory changes to prevent the nation of 125 million from sleepwalking into disaster. 

Uniqlo’s agility and swelling global prominence runs counter to the diminishing imprint of many storied Japanese firms. Up until the 2000s, Japan teemed with engineering pioneers: Casio; Seiko; Fujifilm. But in recent years, complacency, conservative leadership, and fierce competition have seen Japanese brands fall behind.

“Japanese businesses are managed as if they are looking in the rear-view mirror,” Yanai says.

But as the humanitarian crisis inside the besieged territory deepens—over 10,000 civilians have now been killed, 40% of them children, according to Palestinian officials—pregnant women and their newborn children are left to bear the brunt of a healthcare system in a state of total collapse.

More than a third of the hospitals and two-thirds of primary healthcare clinics have shut down due to a lack of fuel, and those still operating are overwhelmed with casualties and grappling with critical shortages of clean water, medicine, and other supplies, the UNFPA reports.

“Fear is the common condition of every pregnant woman,” Dr. Bassam Zaqquot tells TIME in a phone interview. But without any proper medical equipment or facilities, he says that all he can do is prescribe basic medication and give general advice. “We are trying to do our best, but we don't have treatment or solutions,” he says. “It's a terrible situation. It's very difficult.”

In May, a team of more than 140 health care workers performed the 21-hour procedure on Aaron James, a 46-year-old Arkansas man badly injured in a workplace accident in 2021.

James was lucky to survive, but lost his left eye, much of his face, and part of his left arm.
