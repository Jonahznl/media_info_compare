President Biden on Sunday hailed on Sunday the release of Avigail Idan, a 4-year-old U.S. citizen who Hamas held for seven weeks, and vowed to keep working to secure freedom for others in captivity and extend the pause in the fighting.

Avigail, whose name has sometimes been rendered as ‚ÄúAbigail‚Äù in the U.S. news media, is a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen and was seized during the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7 after her parents were killed. Her case had been the focus of widespread international attention and concern as she turned 4 on Friday.

The reporters scrutinized each case, conducting more than 250 interviews; obtaining tens of thousands of pages of confidential treatment records; and visiting courthouses, jails, prisons and psychiatric wards. The lack of public information about the incidents made it impossible to draw conclusions about a quarter of the cases.

Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri, was built during World War II and has made nearly all the rifle cartridges used by the U.S. military since it pulled out of Vietnam.

The plant, operated by a private contractor with Army oversight, is now one of the country‚Äôs biggest manufacturers of commercial rounds for the popular AR-15, and it remains so even as the U.S. government supplies ammunition to Ukraine.

A vast majority of Lake City rounds sold by retailers have been purchased by law-abiding citizens, including hunters, farmers and target shooters. Some of those people are drawn to the ammunition because it‚Äôs made with the same materials, and often to the same specifications, as the military‚Äôs. Others see the rounds as authentic accessories for their tactical weapons and gear.

But more than one million pages of search warrants, police evidence logs, ballistics reports, forfeiture records and court proceedings compiled by The Times provide a sweeping accounting of how Lake City ammunition, once intended for war, has also cut a criminal path through towns and cities in nearly all 50 states.

The third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday devolved at times into brutal personal attacks as the five candidates onstage tried to discuss high-minded issues from the fate of Social Security to the role of America abroad between cutting asides and provocative insults.

The most heated exchange came over the unlikely issue of TikTok. After Vivek Ramaswamy bragged about using the Chinese-owned social media network to broadcast his message, he turned to his adversary, Nikki Haley, and mocked her daughter for using the app.

But the debate did address weighty issues: whether a soaring budget deficit required a higher retirement age for access to Social Security and Medicare, how the U.S. should back Israel against Hamas and Ukraine against Russia, and how a president could immediately address the strain of inflation in everyday life.

The plan: Put a minimal number of American troops on the ground and have them pound the enemy with relentless artillery fire. What no one foresaw was the devastating toll it would take on the troops who did the firing.

Research has started to reveal that as with hits in football, repeated blast exposure from firing heavy weapons may cause irreparable injury to the brain. It is a sprawling problem that the military is just starting to come to grips with.
