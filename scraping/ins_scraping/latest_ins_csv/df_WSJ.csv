‚Å†
Farmworkers and families in Greenfield believe cancer cases in their community were caused by pesticide. Establishing whether pesticide or another environmental exposure caused cancer in a particular person is difficult. Many factors influence whether someone develops cancer, and the interplay among those forces isn‚Äôt fully understood. ‚Å†

When Agustin Espinoza Jaramillo shuffles to the doctor who treats his prostate cancer, he says he thinks about the three decades he spent applying pesticides to the fields that surround this Greenfield. The 72-year-old long knew some pest-killing chemicals have been linked to health problems including cancer. Even so, his own diagnosis came as a surprise. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say that I fully understood everything I was applying,‚Äù Jaramillo said. ‚Å†

Some research shows pesticides can harm workers and people who live near fields where the chemicals are applied. Exposure to some pesticides has been linked to respiratory problems, neurological disorders and some cancers, said Cynthia Curl, director of the Agricultural Health Lab at Boise State University, who has published studies on the topic. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Many Greenfield residents associate local cancer cases with pesticide exposure, including City Council Member Yanely Martinez.

Enochs and his colleagues are looking for individuals strong enough to withstand the kind of marine heat wave that threatened to wipe out Florida‚Äôs 360-mile-long coral reef this summer‚Äîan ecological disaster that also put the state‚Äôs fishing, tourism and beaches at risk.‚Å†

Regardless of cause, a growing number of college professors in various disciplines around the U.S. are trying to keep professional chitchat from becoming a lost language.‚Å†

Jana Mathews, a professor of Medieval literature at Rollins College, said she understood why many of her students weren‚Äôt getting hired for jobs, saying they offered ‚Äúno evidence that they had the interpersonal or communication skills to succeed at them.‚Äù That prompted her to initiate a Job Market Boot Camp class and similar exercises to help students unmute.‚Å†

Mathews checks the bathrooms to coax out students hiding from the big event in the class, a mixer with alumni to practice professional networking.

‚Å†
Scammers posing as teen girls befriend boys online, share nude photos of a girl and then ask for nude photos in return. Once the boy reciprocates, the schemer demands money be sent by a peer-to-peer payment app and threatens to share the boy‚Äôs photos with his social-media followers if he doesn‚Äôt pay.‚Å†
‚Å†
That is how law-enforcement officials and child-protection experts describe a growing wave of online predators targeting teens. Previously, online sextortion‚Äîas they call it‚Äîlargely involved pedophiles blackmailing kids into sending photos or videos. These new scammers focus on money, law-enforcement officials say.‚Å†

Some 55% of respondents say it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion if she wants it for any reason. The poll, conducted for the Journal by NORC at the University of Chicago, surveyed 1,163 registered voters from Oct. 19-24. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Since the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to the procedure, abortion-rights groups have notched seven consecutive victories in state ballot initiatives. Behind these successes is a decadeslong shift among Americans in support of access to the procedure.‚Å†

‚Å†
Eruptions on Reykjanes Peninsula tend to be characterized not by violent explosions that launch ash and gas skyward, but by lava that oozes over the landscape.‚Å†
‚Å†
The current volcanic activity that has Icelandic authorities worried‚Äîin what is known as the Svartsengi volcanic system‚Äîis in an area near a major airport, power plant and one of the country‚Äôs most popular tourist attractions, the Blue Lagoon spa. ‚Å†

A new eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula wouldn‚Äôt resemble the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano that disrupted the global aviation industry, volcanologists said. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Eyjafjallaj√∂kull, a large volcano in southern Iceland, is topped by an ice cap roughly one-tenth of a mile thick. When it erupted, the viscous, sticky magma contained within interacted with water in the ice cap to cause an explosive eruption that sent a plume of ash miles into the sky.‚Å†
‚Å†
On the Reykjanes Peninsula, which is a flatter landscape, volcanoes take the form of vents or fissures on the surface. Magma doesn‚Äôt come straight up to the surface there, according to University of Iceland volcanologist Thor Thordarson. It rises as vertical sheets and collects in subterranean storage zones. As the magma accumulates in these reservoirs, it lifts the surface of the land to relieve pressure. Once that internal pressure exceeds the strength of the rock surrounding it, cracks form that magma can follow up to the surface.‚Å†

Loneliness and social isolation were linked to an increased risk of death from any cause, according to new research. That includes missing out on seeing loved ones, not having weekly group activities like a book club, or just often feeling lonely.‚Å†
‚Å†
A combination of several loneliness factors could be even more harmful, the data suggested. For example, having few family and friend visits was riskier when the person also lived alone. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The study, published last week in the medical journal BMC Medicine, tracked people for more than a decade and collected loneliness data before the Covid-19 pandemic. It adds to increasing evidence that loneliness can be bad for our health, contributing to health problems including anxiety, heart disease and dementia.‚Å†
‚Å†
The researchers looked at five measures for loneliness and isolation: often feeling lonely, not being able to confide in a close companion, living alone, how often people visit with friends and family, and weekly group activities. All of them had an impact.‚Å†
‚Å†
The strongest link was for people who were never visited by family and friends, which was associated with a 39% increase in risk of death during the study period compared with those with daily visits. Those who had at least monthly friend and family visits had a lower risk of dying, the researchers said, but seeing them more often didn‚Äôt appear to add an additional benefit.‚Å†

‚Å†
People sprawled on sidewalks and using fentanyl with no fear of consequence have become a common sight in cities such as Eugene and Portland. Business owners and local leaders are upset, but so are liberal voters who hoped decriminalization would lead to more people getting help. In reality, few drug users are taking advantage of new state-funded rehabilitation programs.‚Å†
‚Å†
Change appears likely. A coalition of city officials, police chiefs and district attorneys recently called on the state legislature to recriminalize hard drugs. A measure to do so is in the works for next year‚Äôs ballot. A recent poll found the majority of Oregonians support the idea.‚Å†
‚Å†
The fundamental problem, according to law-enforcement officers and researchers, is that the threat of jail time hasn‚Äôt been replaced with a new incentive for people struggling with addiction to seek treatment.‚Å†
‚Å†
Some 6,000 tickets have been issued for drug possession since decriminalization went into effect in 2021, but just 92 people have called and completed assessments needed to connect them to services, according to the nonprofit that operates the helpline. The only penalty for those who don‚Äôt call is a $100 fine, which is rarely enforced.‚Å†
‚Å†
Advocates of drug decriminalization blame Oregon‚Äôs continued problems on nationwide trends, including the rise of deadly fentanyl and increased homelessness.‚Å†
‚Å†
They say Measure 110 is already succeeding at one of its goals: keeping people out of the criminal-justice system for drug possession. About 4,000 people were arrested for drug offenses in Oregon in 2022, down from 11,000 in 2020.‚Å†

‚Å†
These days, too few people are voluntarily leaving their jobs.‚Å†
‚Å†
Turnover has declined so steeply at some large employers that companies now find themselves over budget on certain teams, requiring leaders to weigh whether to postpone projects or to cut additional staff as the end of year approaches. Other bosses worry about how to keep star employees engaged when there are far fewer vacant positions internally, making it harder to move people into new roles.‚Å†
‚Å†
The decline in quitting would seem a welcome development for bosses who spent years bemoaning high levels of job-hopping and rapidly rising salaries. But some executives said they have been caught by surprise at how quickly the labor-market dynamics flipped, posing new challenges.‚Å†
‚Å†
Morgan Stanley had layoffs in recent months in part because of low attrition within the 80,000-person Wall Street firm, CEO James Gorman said on a call with investors in mid-October.‚Å†
‚Å†
Employers try to accurately predict how many staffers will quit in a given year to help set budgets for teams and establish hiring plans. Software company ServiceNow uses a machine-learning model to anticipate the number of employees it expects will step down each quarter. Voluntary turnover this year has fallen below levels forecast by those models, said Sarah Tilley, senior vice president of global talent. She didn‚Äôt cite specific figures, but attrition among top-performing employees in 2023 is less than half of what it was in 2022.‚Å†

In his spare time, he also tackles another impenetrable riddle of the galaxy: What is the best way to board airplanes?‚Å†
‚Å†
Steffen‚Äôs frustration with the boarding process began with an unpleasant trip to the airport in Seattle, where he waited in many lines. He thought the last one, at the jet bridge, was unnecessary.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúThere should be a solution to this‚Äîno matter how weird it might be,‚Äù the 48-year-old said.‚Å†
‚Å†
His annoyance, which you don‚Äôt have to be an astrophysicist to understand, led him to develop what he says is the optimal boarding strategy.‚Å†
‚Å†
Here‚Äôs how it works: The first person to board a single-aisle jet like a Boeing 737 is the passenger in the window seat of the last row. Say that‚Äôs 30A. The next person would be exactly two rows away in 28A, followed by 26A, 24A and 22A until the window seats in even rows on the right side were full. Next are the window seats in even rows on the left side: 30F, 28F, 26F and so on. Then come window seats in odd rows on the right and left starting from the back. The same patterns apply to middle seats and aisle seats until the last person on board plops into the front row.‚Å†
‚Å†
The idea is to reduce the probability of traffic jams. If the primary bottleneck of the boarding process is people waiting in the aisle, mostly because of how long it takes for others to load their luggage, Steffen‚Äôs fix maximizes the number of passengers stuffing their bags into overhead bins simultaneously. It takes a serial process (one at a time) and makes it parallel (several at a time).‚Å†
‚Å†
Steffen‚Äôs academic theories might be too idealistic to overcome the realities of the business, but it‚Äôs still worth exploring why they work.‚Å†

Garment workers in Bangladesh make as little as $3 a day, or about $75 a month. In recent days, tens of thousands have refused to work, calling for the minimum wage to be raised to nearly three times that amount. Demonstrations have spiraled, with factories set ablaze and machines smashed. Some three hundred factories stopped operations.‚Å†

‚Å†
Factory owners in Bangladesh say that for them to hike wages in a big way, Western brands that are their top buyers need to pay more for clothes.

Most Asian and African migrants make multiple airport stopovers in what are coming to be known as ‚Äúdonkey flights‚Äù to reach countries such as Brazil, Ecuador or Nicaragua, which have few or no visa requirements for some nationalities. Once they set foot in Latin America, they move north in buses or cars and stay at hotels booked by smuggling organizations.‚Å†
‚Å†
For the second year in a row, arrests by the Border Patrol at the U.S. Southern border surpassed two million. Most of them, almost nine out of 10 apprehensions, are of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. But the surge in so-called extracontinental migrants poses a challenge for the U.S. because deporting migrants to Africa and Asia is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes not possible.‚Å†

‚Å†
Instead, Awad Darawshe helped those wounded in Hamas‚Äôs violent rampage. ‚ÄúIt cost him his life,‚Äù said his sister, Raya Darawshe.‚Å†
‚Å†
The 23-year-old Arab citizen of Israel was working as a medic at an all-night music festival in southern Israel on the morning Hamas militants broke out of the Gaza Strip, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage.‚Å†
‚Å†
While terrified revelers fled, Darawshe stayed to treat the victims and was shot by Hamas, becoming one of more than a dozen Arabs who were killed or captured in the wide-scale attacks.‚Å†
‚Å†
Their deaths illustrate the dilemma facing members of the country‚Äôs Arab minority, as war between Israel and Hamas pulls them between their country and their kin. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were driven from their homes during the war that erupted upon the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Those who remained and their descendants‚Äîcolloquially called ‚Äô48 Arabs‚Äîmake up about 20% of the population and are dubbed Arab-Israelis by the state. They have largely sought integration in Israel and enjoy equal rights on paper, but many say they feel like second-class citizens.‚Å†

American sisters Jana and Mena Timraz rejoiced when their names appeared on the list on Thursday. But their parents, brothers and Jana‚Äôs husband, who aren‚Äôt U.S. citizens, were missing from the roster. ‚ÄúMy husband said ‚ÄòGo save yourself and son‚Äîthat‚Äôs the most important thing,‚Äô‚Äù recalls Jana, cradling her 3-month-old son in a hotel in Cairo, having left the rest of her family behind in Gaza.‚Å†

Their story is among the tales of heart-rending dilemmas and bureaucratic hurdles emerging from those fleeing Gaza in the past few days. After a weekslong diplomatic wrangle to get the frontier open for foreign nationals and the injured, the task of choosing who goes through is arguably more arduous.‚Å†
‚Å†
The exodus was complicated further by the suspension of crossings on Saturday morning, when Hamas, the U.S.-designated terror organization that runs the Gaza Strip, said it wouldn‚Äôt open the border unless Israel agreed to the safe passage of ambulances heading to the crossing. An ambulance near the largest hospital in Gaza City was struck Friday by the Israelis, who said they were targeting Hamas militants using the vehicle. The border opened again on Monday.‚Å†
‚Å†
About 60 different nations have asked Egypt for around 7,600 foreign nationals‚Äîmany of Palestinian heritage‚Äîto be allowed to leave Gaza, according to senior Egyptian officials. Among them are between 500 and 600 Americans. In its first three days of operation, some 1,027 dual nationals went through the crossing.

Jewish employees such as Alyssa Bleser, chief legal officer at a cannabis company, say they‚Äôre troubled by rising antisemitism and feeling alienated and unsupported by the lack of response from co-workers and bosses. ‚ÄúI would like to see my non-Jewish colleagues and friends speak up,‚Äù says Bleser.‚Å†

He snapped it up for ¬£15 plus postage, then turned around and sold it to a collector for a couple of thousand pounds.‚Å†
‚Å†
In the following years, the same seller kept unearthing incredible finds at rock-bottom prices. Gradel inquired as to how he had come across these items. The seller said he had acquired them from his grandfather, who died in 1953. The oddly credible backstory left Gradel comfortable that he had encountered every dealer‚Äôs dream seller. ‚Å†

Then, in 2016, the seller posted a piece on eBay by mistake. Intrigued by the item, Gradel screenshotted it. But the seller quickly removed it from the website and said that it actually belonged to his sister, who didn‚Äôt want to sell it. ‚Å†

Gradel thought not much more about it. But in 2020, he came across an image on the British Museum‚Äôs website that showed the exact same item in its collection.

‚Å†
‚ÄúI wanted to bring to your attention what l believe is a critical gap in how we as a company approach harm, and how the people we serve experience it,‚Äù he began. Though Meta regularly issued public reports suggesting that it was largely on top of safety issues on its platforms, he wrote, the company was deluding itself.‚Å†
‚Å†
The experience of young users on Meta‚Äôs Instagram‚Äîwhere Bejar had spent the previous two years working as a consultant‚Äîwas especially acute. In a subsequent email to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, one statistic stood out: One in eight users under the age of 16 said they had experienced unwanted sexual advances on the platform over the previous seven days.‚Å†
‚Å†
For Bejar, that finding was hardly a surprise. His daughter and her friends had been receiving unsolicited penis pictures and other forms of harassment on the platform since the age of 14, he wrote, and Meta‚Äôs systems generally ignored their reports‚Äîor responded by saying that the harassment didn‚Äôt violate platform rules.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI asked her why boys keep doing that,‚Äù Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg and his top lieutenants. ‚ÄúShe said if the only thing that happens is they get blocked, why wouldn‚Äôt they?‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
For the well-being of its users, Bejar argued, Meta needed to change course, focusing less on a flawed system of rules-based policing and more on addressing such bad experiences. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI am appealing to you because I believe that working this way will require a culture shift,‚Äù Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg‚Äîthe company would have to acknowledge that its existing approach to governing Facebook and Instagram wasn‚Äôt working.‚Å†
‚Å†
Two years later, the problems Bejar identified remain unresolved, and new blind spots have emerged.

So far, few have been large, but residents are on edge: They live on top of a supervolcano, a classification given to about 20 of the world‚Äôs largest volcanoes. The constant earthquakes are a sign of volcanic activity deep underground.‚Å†
‚Å†
Vesuvius, southeast of Naples, which destroyed Pompeii in the first century A.D., is the region‚Äôs most famous volcano. But modern volcanologists are far more worried about the cluster of low-lying craters around Pozzuoli known as Campi Flegrei. The 80-square-mile depression is home to more than a dozen conical volcanoes, several crater lakes‚Äîand half a million residents. Another 800,000 people live just outside the depression.‚Å†
