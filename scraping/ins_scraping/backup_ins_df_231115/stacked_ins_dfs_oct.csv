In September, Pasco authorities approved a $540 million plan to add a fourth boiler to the county‚Äôs waste-to-energy facility. These plants handle highly hazardous materials, and even the cleanest operations emit federally allowable levels of noxious chemicals formed during combustion.

Proponents of the plants point out the energy they generate helps power local communities. But residents‚Äô concerns over the potential health risks have drawn more scrutiny around the project.

Ana Vale relocated her family from Atlanta last year to a home in Doral, Florida, about 20 doors down from Miami-Dade County‚Äôs incinerator. About two weeks after moving in, her now-14-year-old daughter began complaining about her skin itching and burning. Soon afterward, a dermatologist diagnosed her with eczema.

While recent research has linked environmental toxins, including air pollution, to rising rates of eczema, Vale said her daughter‚Äôs doctor didn‚Äôt draw any conclusions about the role of the incinerator. But she believes it‚Äôs a factor.

West Virginia was among the first states to restrict some or all trans student athletes from playing on school sports teams consistent with their gender identities.

A hearing in front of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals was the most recent update in her more than two-year legal battle, which began in May 2021, when she was 11, a month after West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill that bars transgender girls from playing on girls sports teams in middle school, high school and college.

The appeals court will decide whether the law will take effect, and its decision could also start a chain of events that could land Becky‚Äôs case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Becky has been allowed to run on her school‚Äôs cross country team and throw discus and shot put on the track and field team since the appeals court reinstated a previous injunction against the law in February.

But as much as it may feel imperative to stay fully engaged in the tragic updates and charged conversations like those about Israel and Gaza, doing so without boundaries may lead to compassion fatigue, said Dr. Rebecca Sachs, a clinical psychologist based in New York City.

The term was created to capture the experience of people in caretaking roles or professions ‚Äî such as therapists, firefighters, police officers, emergency room health care professionals and family members caring for someone with a chronic condition, said Dr. Charles Figley, Kurzweg Distinguished Chair in Disaster Mental Health at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Those who are watching traumatic things unfold in communities they are connected to as well as those they empathize with from afar may also feel the impact of compassion fatigue, Sachs said. That can lead to exhaustion, irritability and difficulty continuing to engage with their empathy if not attended to, Sachs said.

Israel has since allowed some water to flow through one of the three pipelines that run into Gaza, but experts say it covers only a tiny percentage of the enclave‚Äôs needs. Most of Gaza‚Äôs water comes from local sources ‚Äì but the fuel required to pump and clean it is fast running out.

The climate crisis is also having an impact. Sea level rise will increase the salinity of the groundwater and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat and drought further threaten water resources.

Without the ability to access the site and gather evidence from the ground, no conclusion can be definitive.

Trucking companies often refuse to hire women if the businesses do not have women available to train them.

The video shows a projectile streaking through the darkened skies over Gaza and exploding in the air. Seconds later, another explosion is seen on the ground.

The footage has become a widely cited piece of evidence as Israeli and American officials have made the case that an errant Palestinian rocket malfunctioned in the sky, fell to the ground and caused a deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

But a detailed visual analysis by The New York Times concludes that the video clip ‚Äî taken from an Al Jazeera television camera livestreaming on the night of Oct. 17 ‚Äî shows something else. The projectile seen in the video is most likely not what caused the explosion at the hospital. It actually detonated in the sky roughly two miles away, The Times found, and is an unrelated aspect of the fighting that unfolded over the Israeli-Gaza border that night.

The Times‚Äôs finding does not answer what did cause the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital blast, or who is responsible. The contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch is to blame remains plausible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.

The hospital blast has become a searing, contested episode in the war that began on Oct. 7, after Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, invaded Israel, killing more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers and seizing 200 hostages who were taken back to Gaza, according to the Israeli government. Israel has responded with a relentless artillery and bombing campaign that has killed 5,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry. The Israeli military is also preparing for a ground invasion.

A network of Jews in America and Israel who believe it is a sacred duty to carry out this funeral rite have continued to bring Jews who died in New York, in California or anywhere abroad to their Holy Land for the final time. Recently, a mostly volunteer corps charged with performing sacred burial rites awaited the arrival of seven New Yorkers at Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel.

In wartime, most bodies fly alone: It is unsafe for relatives and loved ones to accompany them to the burial. So the corps, known as the chevra kadisha, steps in to do the mitzvah, or good deed: They pray over, care for and bury these strangers from abroad.

Nearly half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people have been displaced, and they are facing increasingly desperate conditions, according to the U.N. Local officials say thousands have been killed.

The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas, which controls Gaza, waged a brutal assault on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people. A ground offensive could be Israel‚Äôs next step. Its troops have been massing along the border, but it is unclear when they might enter Gaza.

One of the challenges they will face is that Hamas took more than 200 hostages from Israel, according to the Israeli military.

The report included a large headline at the top of The Times‚Äôs website.

Israel subsequently denied being at fault and blamed an errant rocket launch by the Palestinian faction group Islamic Jihad, which has in turn denied responsibility. American and other international officials have said their evidence indicates that the rocket came from Palestinian fighter positions.

The Times‚Äôs initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage ‚Äî and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels ‚Äî relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.

The Times continued to update its coverage as more information became available, reporting the disputed claims of responsibility and noting that the death toll might be lower than initially reported. Within two hours, the headline and other text at the top of the website reflected the scope of the explosion and the dispute over responsibility.

Farmers are grappling with shocks that made fertilizer scarce and unaffordable, diminishing harvests, raising food prices and spreading hunger. The war in Ukraine reduced the region‚Äôs grain exports and sent the price of staples like wheat soaring from Egypt to Indonesia. The world‚Äôs food supply is also menaced by the ravages of climate change ‚Äî heat waves, drought, floods. 

The breakdown in fertilizer production challenges the orthodoxy that has dominated international trade for decades. Prominent economists have promoted globalization as insurance against upheaval. When factories in one place cannot produce goods, they can be summoned from somewhere else. Yet as farmers across Africa and parts of Asia contend with fertilizer shortages, their anguish attests to a less celebrated aspect of the interlinked economy: Shared dependence on vital products from dominant suppliers yields widespread danger when shocks emerge.

Gazans, already living under a blockade by Israel and Egypt, have been increasingly desperate since Israel responded to Hamas‚Äôs brutal Oct. 7 terrorist attack with airstrikes and a ‚Äúcomplete siege‚Äù of the enclave. Nearly half the population has been displaced, according to the U.N., and dwindling essential resources threaten disaster for its more than two million residents.

Gaza health officials said at a news conference that at least 3,785 people had been killed in the enclave since Oct. 7. The figures are believed to include casualties from the hospital explosion in Gaza City.

The state has sent away more than 50,000 migrants, helping to provoke a shelter crisis in several U.S. cities like Denver and Chicago that has reshaped the debate over immigration.

The program is now an organized migrant transportation system that helps alleviate the strain of new arrivals on small border cities at a cost of roughly $75 million, and that number is growing. Still, it has not succeeded in what is perhaps Abbott‚Äôs biggest goal: forcing the federal government to adopt more stringent border controls, favored by Republicans.

Now, Abbott is trying to change Texas law to make crossing the border from Mexico without authorization a state crime, allowing the police in Texas to arrest people coming across the Rio Grande, including asylum seekers. The State Senate passed the bill this month during a special legislative session, though it has yet to be approved by the Texas House.

But many migrants crossing between points of entry now spend their first steps on U.S. soil confronted by Operation Lone Star, the multibillion-dollar initiative that Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas started two years ago and bolstered again last month to address the border crisis and to prevent drug and human smuggling.

Over a period of 10 days in late September and October, The New York Times documented the El Paso border from the Mexico side.

Chandler was nearly Perry‚Äôs double: a tortured loner for whom cynicism was body armor. He died prematurely on Saturday, at 54.

Flip, sarcastic and allergic to attachment, Perry typified the Gen X sensibility in his 10 years as Chandler. Our age cohort (I was born in 1966, Perry three years later) has frequently been dismissed as nondescript, but what is special about us has become apparent in retrospect. We were the last generation to grow up predigital, meaning spoken conversation was our default means of communication. We were scarred by divorce, which peaked when we were kids, like no generation before or since. Many of us sought to build replacement families out of pals living close at hand, taking dorm living as our model.

Perry‚Äôs portrayal of Chandler was informed by revealing conversations he had with the show‚Äôs writers. Unlike Matt LeBlanc‚Äôs Joey Tribbiani (a caricature of a brainless actor) and David Schwimmer‚Äôs Ross Geller (painfully earnest and therefore not typical of a generation that venerates irony), Chandler was the perpetual wry observer, wisecracking from a distance.

His cynicism and sarcasm were a reflection of our own outlook on life.

Anxious consumers have turned to weed and edibles for relief as treatments for their ailments have become harder to find. The number of available and affordable therapists badly lags demand and traditional medications don‚Äôt work for everyone.‚Å†
‚Å†
Driving both users‚Äô and businesses‚Äô hopes is a belief that pot can make us less anxious. Yet little independent scientific evidence shows that cannabis is an effective treatment for anxiety problems, and some studies have found it can worsen symptoms. Researchers say this is particularly true for products high in THC, the substance responsible for marijuana‚Äôs intoxicating effects.‚Å†
‚Å†
Cannabis use was significantly associated with increased odds of developing anxiety conditions, according to a review of research published in 2020 in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Recent cannabis use was associated with more severe symptoms in people with anxiety and mood disorders, according to another review published in 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In some surveys, cannabis users have reported that they have felt relief from anxiety symptoms after consuming cannabis. ‚Å†
‚Å†
A survey last year found that nearly two-thirds of people said they would prefer to use cannabis rather than pharmaceuticals to treat a medical issue, according to the survey conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of cannabis company Curaleaf of almost 2,000 adults who were at least 21 years old. And among the 54% of respondents who said they had ever used cannabis, 41% of them said they consumed cannabis to reduce anxiety.‚Å†

‚Å†
The number of Anchorage residents without homes grew nearly 60% between 2019 and 2023 to an estimated 1,760. That is more than bigger cities including Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.; Baltimore, and Oklahoma City, based on point-in-time counts conducted once each year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Allowing people to stay on the streets means likely injury or death in a city that experiences an average of 20 days annually below zero degrees Fahrenheit. But an arena used to house those without homes the past three winters was recently closed, and political infighting killed plans to build a large new shelter. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Now, as part of a plan approved just a month before bitterly cold temperatures typically arrive in mid-November, aid workers are scrambling to get an estimated 700 people living outdoors into a network of hotel rooms and other makeshift facilities. Some are being offered one-way tickets to the Lower 48 states.‚Å†
‚Å†
Cold weather is a growing public-health threat as more people live on the streets nationwide. Nationally, about 700 homeless people a year die from exposure to the cold, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit group. In Anchorage, a record 43 people have died from cold and other causes outdoors so far this year, compared with six in all of 2019.‚Å†

Now, many cities riddled with half-empty office buildings are hoping to survive the new remote-work era without bulldozing swaths of downtown and starting from scratch.‚Å†
‚Å†
American downtowns instead face the biggest urban makeover in 50 years, experts say. It's a turning point similar to when factories disappeared from city centers during the 20th century‚Äôs workplace transformation and left steel-and-glass office towers as the primary economic engines.‚Å†
‚Å†
Even optimists estimate it will take years and cost billions to complete the large-scale changes to usher central-city office districts into a new role‚Äîbusy neighborhoods where people live, work, raise families and find entertainment.‚Å†
‚Å†
Some cities have been pushing to remake their downtown districts for years and know the many obstacles: Few office buildings can be converted to housing. Downtowns don‚Äôt easily accommodate family life. Crime fears keep people in the suburbs. No one wants to be downtown if nobody else is.‚Å†
‚Å†
Minneapolis, which has seen lonely sidewalks and empty storefronts in its downtown, is considering a pedestrian-only zone and has offered tax breaks to convert offices to apartments.

WSJ,Cy3kHuuNK6p,2023-10-26 16:09:10,GraphImage,"One of the most durable forces shaping the U.S. electorate is that voters tend to lean more Republican as they age.‚Å†
‚Å†
But it also matters where they begin on the political spectrum, and there are indications that millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z started out more liberal than prior generations. That has made them a crucial base of support for Democrats, even as some other groups of voters have moved away from the party.‚Å†
‚Å†
Gaining assets and income pushes voters toward conservative fiscal policies, such as lower taxes, that allow them to keep more of their money, researchers say. As Americans move from midlife to retirement, they are more likely to favor stability over change, and less likely to back liberal policies that upset the social order.‚Å†
‚Å†
This rightward shift is likely to affect who wins elections in 2024 and the years beyond. One in six Americans is age 65 or over, up from one in eight a decade prior, according to the most recent decennial census. A slump in births that started in 2008 will eventually give way to a smaller pool of new, young voters.‚Å†

Hendeles, a retired professor, with his friend, fellow pharmacist and University of Florida professor Randy Hatton, have spent nearly 20 years following the science of phenylephrine, an ingredient in more than 200 over-the-counter decongestants.‚Å†

WSJ,CyzJlrEt8bM,2023-10-24 23:00:25,GraphImage,"More than a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, one thing seems clear: New state bans have done little so far to deter women from obtaining abortions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Data released Tuesday shows the number of abortions ticked up slightly in the year following the high court‚Äôs Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization decision. That ruling, from June 2022, ended federal protections for the procedure, and paved the way for some 16 states to ban many or most abortions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The data indicate that abortion providers, funders and others have adapted quickly to a legal landscape that has changed profoundly. Access has been cut off throughout much of the South, and demand has surged in states in which abortion is still legal. Many providers there have had to significantly increase capacity. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In the new study, WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, found that nationwide there were 183 more monthly abortions on average in the 12-month period following the Dobbs decision compared with the monthly average prior to the decision. ‚Å†
‚Å†
While it has become much harder since the end of Roe to obtain an abortion in states with newly enacted bans, it actually appears to have become easier in many other states, thanks to increased attention and resources. Abortion funds, nonprofits that help finance abortions and logistics associated with them, have raised millions to help lower-income women pay for procedures and travel, while new clinics have opened in states such as Illinois and New Mexico that have become major destinations for women traveling from other states. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Nearly 115,000 fewer abortions were performed in the year after the Dobbs decision in states that banned abortions throughout pregnancy or after six weeks, according to the WeCount data. At the same time, states including Illinois, Florida and North Carolina‚Äîwhere the procedure remained largely legal‚Äîsaw an increase of 117,000 abortions. ‚Å†

‚Å†
Brazilian officials have been bedeviled by a new phenomenon: a small but growing number of African migrants who completed a perilous 2,000-mile journey from West Africa after sneaking onto cargo ships they believed were actually headed for Europe or the U.S.‚Å†
‚Å†
Some African arrivals say criminal gangs and fishermen in West Africa tricked them into boarding the wrong ships, charging a small fee to hoist them aboard, including onto narrow platforms behind the ship‚Äôs rudder, according to researchers and authorities studying clandestine immigration. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI was gutted,‚Äù Ekow said, describing the moment the ship‚Äôs captain told him he was not in the U.S. but in Macap√°, Brazil, where the Atlantic meets the Amazon River.‚Å†
‚Å†
The 24-year-old and a friend boarded the ship in Abidjan with the help of a local fisherman. During the trip the men huddled together for warmth, rationing out tins of sardines and a bottled mush of cassava flour and water. By the third day, the food was gone. By the fifth, they ran out of water.‚Å†
‚Å†
On the seventh day, the ship suddenly slowed down. Police officers at the port of Macap√° said they could either go back to Africa or stay in Brazil and file for asylum, Ekow said. Both opted for the latter. His friend, who had brought a fistful of dollars with him, told Ekow he was going to try and trudge to the U.S.‚Å†

‚Å†
‚ÄúI have extreme confidence,‚Äù the Florida Republican said in an interview from his Capitol Hill office, ‚Äúthat we will have an upgrade at the position.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The House has had no speaker since Gaetz made a motion to vacate the position, then joined on Oct. 3 with seven other Republicans and 208 Democrats to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) from the role. Rep. Jim Jordan, the archconservative Ohio Republican whom Gaetz calls a mentor, this week failed on three ballots to secure the majority of the body‚Äôs votes, losing support on each roll call and then bowing out of the race Friday afternoon. No one else seems to have a clear path to 217 GOP votes for the position. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Many of his colleagues blame Gaetz for the paralysis and acrimony that have ensued. When Gaetz rose to speak in a closed-door party meeting on Thursday, McCarthy told him to ‚Äúsit your ass down,‚Äù and another Republican, Rep. Mike Bost of Illinois, cursed and lunged at Gaetz.‚Å†
‚Å†
Asked about the encounter afterward, McCarthy told reporters, ‚ÄúListen, the whole country, I think, would scream at Matt Gaetz right now.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The upheavals that have racked the House GOP since January are less a reflection of any coherent faction than one man‚Äôs singular will. It was Gaetz who took it upon himself to block McCarthy from the speakership in January, joining with 19 others to deny him a majority until he agreed to crippling concessions. One of those was the ability for a single member to bring the motion to vacate, which Gaetz then deployed to remove McCarthy this month.‚Å†

‚Å†
Research is making clearer the role that genes play in living to very old age. Habits like getting enough sleep, exercising and eating a healthy diet can help you stave off disease and live longer, yet when it comes to living beyond 90, genetics start to play a trump card, say researchers who study aging.‚Å†
‚Å†
About 25% of your ability to live to 90 is determined by genetics, says Dr. Thomas Perls, a professor of medicine at Boston University who leads the New England Centenarian Study. By age 100, it‚Äôs roughly 50% genetic, he estimates, and by around 106, it‚Äôs 75%.‚Å†
‚Å†
Centenarians make up a growing share of the U.S. population. There are about 109,000 centenarians living in the country in 2023, according to Census Bureau projections, up from about 65,000 10 years ago, thanks in part to decades of advances in medicine and public health.‚Å†
‚Å†
Knowing what enables some people to live very long lives has consequences for the rest of us. Ongoing research into very old age may help provide insight that could eventually be used to develop drugs or identify lifestyle changes to help people live healthier for longer, says Dr. James Kirkland, president of the American Federation for Aging Research.‚Å†
‚Å†
Perls estimates that roughly 20% of the population has the genetic makeup that could get them to 100 if they also make consistent healthy choices.‚Å†

Its new location: Connelly‚Äôs office and that of his remotely working boss. His supervisor said he didn‚Äôt mind having his former desk occupied by an exhibit on botanical explorers, among others, earlier this year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Around seven months ago, Connelly, shown here, hung a sign in the hallway proclaiming ‚ÄúMuseum‚Äù in antique-looking font, inviting passersby to stop by his warren of rooms crammed with artifacts, photos, typed placards explaining the historical significance, framed newspaper articles and colorful prints covering every inch of available wall and desktop.‚Å†
‚Å†
At the time it was built in the 1930s, the USDA‚Äôs South Building was believed to be the largest office building in the world, with 4,500 rooms, 7 miles of corridors, 12 million bricks and 11,000 miles of structural steel, according to the General Services Administration. ‚Å†

Connelly, a 35-year veteran of the agency, wasn‚Äôt always combing through that labyrinth looking for historical finds. But during the pandemic, he returned to the office earlier than many others and began walking the empty halls. ‚Å†
‚Å†
He began doing more research into the history of the agency, founded in 1862 by then-President Abraham Lincoln to deepen agricultural research and disseminate information at a time when about half of all Americans lived on farms. ‚Å†

‚Å†
The Journal found hundreds of merchants offering the new drug, which is being developed by Eli Lilly and is called retatrutide. Most appear to be Chinese sellers shipping directly to U.S. consumers from sites such as Made-in-China.com. Some of the sites, including ones that appear to be based in the U.S., have marketed their products via posts on Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit. A handful have run paid ads on Instagram and Google. A fitness influencer has offered it for sale via his newsletter.‚Å†
‚Å†
Excitement over retatrutide jumped in June when Lilly reported Phase 2 trial results that showed the drug led to an average weight loss of up to 24% over 48 weeks. That could prove better than Lilly‚Äôs already-approved drug Mounjaro.‚Å†
‚Å†
In August, the Journal reported that more than 50 websites were selling knockoff semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in Ozempic and Mounjaro respectively. The Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to two websites for ‚Äúunlawful sale of unapproved and misbranded drugs‚Äù after the Journal‚Äôs article. One, GorillaHealing.com, no longer lists those two drugs on its website, but does offer retatrutide.

‚Å†
Sales of previously owned homes in 2023 are expected to dwindle to a rate not seen since at least 2011, when the U.S. population was smaller and the country was still recovering from one of the worst housing crises ever, according to many economist forecasts.‚Å†
‚Å†
Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real-estate brokerage Redfin, estimated that total existing-home sales in 2023 would amount to around 4.1 million, which would mark the smallest number of sales since about 2008, the year that Lehman Brothers collapsed and sparked the global financial crisis. Zhao said sales are unlikely to pick up much next year, with mortgage rates likely to remain at elevated levels. ‚Å†

This year‚Äôs housing slowdown is very different from the previous one, after the housing bubble of the early 2000s burst. Back then, the economy entered a deep recession and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure. ‚Å†

But it‚Äôs a near certainty that some form of this catastrophe will happen someday, says Ian Cohen, a chief scientist who studies heliophysics at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.‚Å†
‚Å†
To get ahead of this threat, a loose federation of U.S. and international government agencies, and hundreds of scientists affiliated with those bodies, have begun working on how to make predictions about what our Sun might do. And a small but growing cadre of scientists argue that artificial intelligence will be an essential component of efforts to give us advance notice of such a storm.‚Å†
‚Å†
The most dangerous of these solar storms is known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME, when a gargantuan blob of charged particles is catapulted from the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere by rapidly shifting magnetic fields, at speeds in excess of 8,000 times that of sound. These happen often, but we‚Äôre rarely aware of them because they only affect us when they happen to strike earth.‚Å†
‚Å†
Satellites that orbit high above Earth in so-called geostationary orbit would be the first to feel the effects. In theory, they can be incapacitated by ‚Äúkiller electrons‚Äù more common during certain kinds of solar storms. The electrons can penetrate satellites, and the resulting charge can build up, damaging electronics. Losing these satellites could cause worldwide disruption of GPS services.‚Å†

WSJ,CyY3VaBMo9U,2023-10-14 18:00:31,GraphSidecar,"After a historic run-up in prices, the luxury rental market in the Miami area is seeing a significant slowdown. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Although rents are still generally higher than they were prepandemic, local real-estate agents said the velocity of people moving to Miami has slowed and there are fewer people willing to overpay. Meanwhile, newly built apartments are adding thousands of rental units to the market, further easing the supply-demand imbalance that has characterized the market over the past few years.‚Å†
‚Å†
In the Miami luxury market, defined as the top 10% of the market, nearly all segments are down from pandemic-era peaks, said local real-estate agent Ana Bozovic, whose firm Analytics.Miami tracks the market. ‚Å†
‚Å†
So far this year, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom house in Miami-Dade County is $8,500, down 15% from $10,000 last year, she said. For condos, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom is $8,200, down 8.9% from $9,000 last year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Overall, Miami‚Äôs rental market seems to be cooling faster than other cities nationwide, according to data from listing website Zumper. In September, the median monthly rent for a Miami one-bedroom apartment fell 1.47% to $2,690 from the month before, and 1.96% to $2,500 in Miami Beach, Zumper said. By comparison, the median rent for a one-bedroom nationwide grew 0.1% to $1,511 during the same period.‚Å†
‚Å†
The dip is a sharp change from the frenzied pace of the real-estate market over the past few years, as an influx of people moved to Miami for warm weather and low taxes, driving up real-estate values to historic levels. ‚Å†

Hamas fighters on the ground explicitly targeted Israeli civilians for killing. Israelis were shot while driving along the street. They were pulled from their homes and killed. Hamas carried out the mass murder of some 260 people at the Tribe of Nova music festival.

Vladimir Putin, a purported friend of Israel, has said little, other than blaming a failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East. No surprise there. What Hamas did to the Israelis is what Putin has been doing to civilians in Ukraine for almost two years.

Since the February 2022 invasion, it is estimated that about 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. Russia has killed hundreds with missiles fired into residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns. It has targeted schools, hospitals and food markets.

These civilian deaths‚Äîby Hamas in Israel and Russia in Ukraine‚Äîare not collateral damage from urban warfare. They are part of the war plan, thought out by calm men sitting around a table, in Moscow or Beirut, looking at maps and civilian targets. Crimes against humanity are becoming normalized.

Our adversaries‚ÄîRussia, Iran, China and North Korea‚Äîwill continue the mass killing of civilians and hostage-taking as a strategic policy until the U.S. decisively counters this awful new normal.

‚Å†
Houston, Dallas and Austin top the list of major U.S. cities with the highest office-vacancy rates, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics. About 25% of their office space wasn‚Äôt leased as of the third quarter. That was more than double New York‚Äôs vacancy rate of 12% and well above San Francisco‚Äôs vacancy rate of 17%.‚Å†

Texas office floors are struggling to find tenants even though the state‚Äôs workers have been more eager to get back to the office than in most other places. According to Kastle Systems, which measures occupancy by counting keycard swipes in 10 major metro areas, Houston, Austin and Dallas have the highest office-return rates.‚Å†
‚Å†
Vacancies are high largely because Texas developers build too much. All three cities experienced a surge in construction in the 1980s, when tax rules favored developers and loose lending created a commercial real-estate bubble. Another construction spurt in the late 1990s aggravated the problem.‚Å†

The younger Arnault is learning the ropes of his father‚Äôs luxury‚Äôs empire, and Louis Vuitton has bet on the 24-year-old to turn the brand into a player in high-end, mechanical watchmaking.‚Å†
‚Å†
Jean was standing in a gilded, mirrored room of Paris‚Äôs Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay showing off Louis Vuitton‚Äôs newest watch model to a clutch of experts one July morning. The thin unisex watch, named the Tambour, was the result of almost two years of work. But the most valuable Tambour in the building wasn‚Äôt on display with the others. It was on Arnault‚Äôs wrist.‚Å†
‚Å†
His version was made of the rare metal tantalum. Tantalum gave the watch its gunmetal color, though the metal‚Äôs hardness also meant that the watch took twice as much time to manufacture. This made it ‚Äúinsanely expensive‚Äù when he bought it, Arnault said, though he refused to reveal what he paid.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only going to make one,‚Äù Arnault said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs the only one.‚Äù‚Å†

‚Å†
Now Arnault has decided to eliminate the entry-level Tambours. His thinking was that instead of producing more affordable collections, Louis Vuitton needed to play in a different class.

Israel's emergency services said 40 people have been killed in the surprise attacks from Gaza and hundreds more injured.

At least 270 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,000 injured, according to Palestinian medical authorities.

Air-raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem, while explosions were heard in Tel Aviv.

WSJ,CyD8ZDRsrTi,2023-10-06 15:01:05,GraphImage,"Americans who eat their way through European vacations sometimes come home surprised to see a lower number on the scale. The phenomenon has become something of an internet debate, with some people speculating that weight loss on European sojourns points to unhealthy American diets and processed foods.‚Å†
‚Å†
So what‚Äôs the real answer? Alas, there‚Äôs no definitive explanation. You might be surprised (or not!) to find out that research on vacation is scant.‚Å†
‚Å†
Scientists who study nutrition and health say that people who lose weight on international travels are likely benefiting from two things: more daily steps while on vacation and, yes, food that is often healthier and less processed.‚Å†
‚Å†
Ultra-processed foods common in the U.S. include artificial additives and highly refined ingredients and are rich in starch, sugar and salt, says Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of nutrition and medicine at Tufts University. He points to a study in the European Journal of Nutrition that found that among adults in the U.S., 57% of calories come from ultra-processed food, compared with 12% in Europe.‚Å†
‚Å†
What‚Äôs more, portion sizes tend to be larger in the U.S., and people drink more sodas and sugar-sweetened beverages, food researchers say. And Europeans often eat in a more leisurely way that is less prone to overeating, they note.‚Å†

‚Å†
Until recently, the school and its faculty largely disdained one of those scientists.‚Å†
‚Å†
Penn demoted Katalin Karik√≥, shunting her to a lab on the outskirts of campus while cutting her pay. Karik√≥‚Äôs colleagues denigrated her mRNA research and some wouldn‚Äôt work with her, according to her and people at the school. Eventually, Karik√≥ persuaded another Penn researcher, Drew Weissman, to work with her on modifying mRNA for vaccines and drugs, though most others at the school remained skeptical, pushing other approaches. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Karik√≥ hasn‚Äôt only proven her detractors wrong but also reached the pinnacle of science. Her research with Weissman helped lead to the mRNA vaccines that protected people worldwide during the Covid-19 pandemic and now shows promise for flu, cancer and other diseases.‚Å†
‚Å†
Penn, which patented their mRNA technology, has made millions of dollars from drugmakers that licensed it. And on Monday, when Karik√≥ and Weissman were awarded the Nobel, the school expressed a different perspective on their work.‚Å†
‚Å†
The reversal offers a glimpse of the clubby, hothouse world of academia and science, where winning financial funding is a constant burden, securing publication is a frustrating challenge and those with unconventional or ambitious approaches can struggle to gain support and acceptance.‚Å†

‚Å†
Bobbi de Winter had found her retirement paradise on Ecuador‚Äôs coast, where tiny red crabs scuttle across pristine beaches, giant sea turtles lay their eggs and whales breach the warm Pacific waters.‚Å†
‚Å†
De Winter, a native of Atlanta, and her husband, Andre, had recently finished building a house overlooking the Pacific, accessible by crossing a lush forest. They set up hammocks, planted banana and papaya trees, and hosted dinner parties as the sun set over the ocean. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Then came the drug gangs and horrific violence. Killings marred the once-sleepy district where they live, De Winter said, recalling how her husband once had to swerve his car to avoid a man who‚Äôd been shot in the street. A month after the De Winters finished their house, police found millions of dollars in cocaine stashed at a nearby beach, drugs that officers said were to be trafficked north on high-powered boats. A presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, was gunned down in August. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Worried about Ecuador‚Äôs deteriorating security, the De Winters now intend to sell. ‚ÄúI had to let go of my dream,‚Äù said De Winter. ‚Å†
‚Å†
This year, Ecuador is on track to top 7,000 killings, seven times the number in 2018, government data shows.‚Å†
‚Å†
Driving the carnage is the country‚Äôs transformation into a transshipment hub for drugs from neighboring Colombia, where cocaine production hit a record high. The disarmament of Colombian drug-trafficking guerrillas in 2016 led to a power vacuum as other gangs battled to take over the routes into Ecuador, with its hundreds of miles of unguarded coast. ‚Å†

‚Å†
Interest rates are up. Inflation remains high. Pandemic savings have shrunk. And the labor market is cooling.‚Å†
‚Å†
Yet household spending, the primary driver of the nation‚Äôs economic growth, remains robust. Americans spent 5.8% more in August than a year earlier, well outstripping less than 4% inflation. And the experience economy boomed this summer, with Delta Air Lines reporting record revenue in the second quarter and Ticketmaster selling over 295 million event tickets in the first six months of 2023, up nearly 18% year-over-year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Economists and financial advisers say consumers putting short-term needs and goals above long-term ones is normal. Still, this moment is different, they say.‚Å†
‚Å†
A tough housing market has more consumers writing off something they‚Äôd historically save for, while the pandemic showed the instability of any long-term plans related to health, work or day-to-day life. So, they are spending on once-in-a-lifetime experiences because they worry they may not be able to do them later.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a regret-filled, spur-of-the-moment decision,‚Äù says Michael Liersch, who oversees a team of advisers as head of advice at Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the opposite of that, where I would regret not having done it.‚Äù‚Å†

Decoys can help mislead an enemy about attack plans or fool an opponent into believing that an area is better defended than it really is, deterring an assault. Deception has been an important tool of warfare throughout history, but the war in Ukraine has presented new challenges. Advances in thermal imaging can reveal targets that are invisible to the naked eye, or expose fakes as inert dummies.

It was specially designed to protect against a range of incoming short-range threats.

The Iron Dome uses radar to identify and destroy incoming threats before they can cause damage.

It can differentiate between missiles likely to hit built-up areas and those that won't. Static and mobile units only launch interceptor missiles to shoot down anything interpreted as dangerous.

The system became operational in 2011 and was developed by Israel with some US support.

‚Å†
Some farmers lost 20% or more of their predicted yields; others, like Mazzotti, left some land bare. Labor costs and inflation are also narrowing margins, hitting farmers‚Äô ability to profit off what they sell to garden centers and pumpkin patches.‚Å†
‚Å†
This year‚Äôs thirsty gourds are a symbol of the reality that farmers who rely on irrigation must continue to face season after season: they have to make choices, based on water allotments and the cost of electricity to pump it out of the ground, about which acres to plant and which crops they can gamble on to make it through hotter and drier summers.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the worst years we‚Äôve had in several years,‚Äù said Mark Carroll, a Texas A&M extension agent for Floyd County. Not only did the hot, dry weather surpass what irrigation could make up for, but pumpkins also need cooler weather to be harvested or they‚Äôll start to decompose during the shipping process, sometimes disintegrating before they even arrive at stores.‚Å†

‚Å†
The report out this week from the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion access, shows the number fell to nearly zero in states with the strictest bans ‚Äî but rose elsewhere, especially in states close to those with the bans. The monthly averages overall from July 2022 through June 2023 were about 200 higher than in May and June 2022.‚Å†
‚Å†
The changes reflect major shifts after the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022 handed down its Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization ruling, overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had made abortion legal nationally. Since last year, most Republican-controlled states have enacted restrictions, while most Democrat-controlled states have extended protections for those from out of state seeking abortion.‚Å†

APNews,Cyy8_bnraxr,2023-10-24 21:10:12,GraphSidecar,"Schools, shops, banks and Iceland‚Äôs famous swimming pools shut on Tuesday as women in the volcanic island nation ‚Äî including the prime minister ‚Äî went on strike to push for an end to unequal pay and gender-based violence.

Icelanders awoke to all-male news teams announcing shutdowns across the country, with public transport delayed, hospitals understaffed and hotel rooms uncleaned. Trade unions, the strike‚Äôs main organizers, called on women and nonbinary people to refuse paid and unpaid work, including chores. About 90% of the country‚Äôs workers belong to a union.

Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsd√≥ttir said she would stay home as part of the strike ‚Äî ‚Äúkvennaverkfall‚Äù in Icelandic ‚Äî and expected other women in her Cabinet would do the same.
Iceland, a rugged island of around 380,000 people just below the Arctic Circle, has been ranked as the world‚Äôs most gender-equal country 14 years in a row by the World Economic Forum, which measures pay, education, health care and other factors.

No country has achieved full equality, and there remains a gender pay gap in Iceland.
Tuesday‚Äôs walkout, running from midnight to midnight, was billed as the biggest since Iceland‚Äôs first such event on Oct. 24, 1975, when 90% of women refused to work, clean or look after children, to voice anger at discrimination in the workplace.

Teams rushed to flood its roots with water, hoping to save a magnificent tree that had provided shade for community events, a picturesque wedding venue and a popular backdrop for posing tourists.‚Å†
‚Å†
But the fire also nearly wiped out another set of trees, one with a much longer history in Lahaina and a greater significance in Hawaiian culture: the breadfruit tree, or ulu, which had given sustenance since Polynesian voyagers introduced it to the islands many centuries ago. Before colonialism, commercial agriculture and tourism, thousands of breadfruit trees dotted Lahaina. The fire charred all but two of the dozen or so that remained.‚Å†
‚Å†
Now, as Maui recovers from the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, which left at least 98 people dead, a band of arborists, farmers and landscapers has set about trying to save Lahaina‚Äôs ulu, kukui nut and other culturally important trees. In some cases this means digging down to the roots of badly burned specimens to find live tissue that could be used to propagate new shoots.‚Å†
‚Å†
They see the destruction as a chance to restore the trees to Lahaina, to teach about their care and use, and to reclaim a bit of the town‚Äôs historic identity amid a larger discussion about whether the community‚Äôs reconstruction will price out locals and Hawaiian culture in favor of deep-pocketed outsiders seeking a slice of tropical paradise.‚Å†

The toll has brought unimaginable grief for Israelis and Palestinians alike. In wrenching scenes, relatives weep over the dead or missing, whose lives were suddenly and violently cut short in an erupting war that has shattered thousands of families.

Women have experienced the starkest changes since the Taliban‚Äôs return.

The concert film, compiled from several Swift shows at Southern California‚Äôs SoFi Stadium, is expected to launch with $100 million, or possibly more. Advance ticket sales worldwide have already surpassed $100 million.‚Å†
‚Å†
Swifties will descend. Dancing will be encouraged.‚Å†
‚Å†
Two of the biggest stars on the planet ‚Äî Swift and, in December under a very similar arrangement, Beyonc√© ‚Äî are heading into cinemas in first-of-their-kind deals made directly with AMC Theaters that circumvent Hollywood studios and which, for now, leave streamers waiting on the sidelines.‚Å†

‚Å†
The footprints were discovered at the edge of an ancient lakebed in White Sands National Park and date back to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, according to research published in the journal Science.‚Å†
‚Å†
The estimated age of the footprints was first reported in Science in 2021, but some researchers raised concerns about the dates. Questions focused on whether seeds of aquatic plants used for the original dating may have absorbed ancient carbon from the lake ‚Äî which could, in theory, throw off radiocarbon dating by thousands of years.‚Å†
‚Å†
The new study presents two additional lines of evidence for the older date range. It uses two entirely different materials found at the site, ancient conifer pollen and quartz grains.‚Å†

‚Å†
Mining operations account for some 4%-7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. But some miners are moving to reduce use of fossil fuels in extracting and refining, partly due to pressure from downstream customers that want more sustainable supply chains.‚Å†

Experts say improved technology, pressure from customers and enforcement of clean energy policies all are needed to keep moving toward more sustainable mining and refining practices while raising output to keep pace with global needs for pivoting away from reliance on polluting fossil fuels.‚Å†

In an ambiguous separation, the couple has not committed to parting ways, nor to figuring how to live together. Some therapists say this situation is more common than people might think.

Studies have suggested that between 6% and 18% of still-married American couples have been through a period of separation. 

There are many reasons people separate but don't divorce. ""It's hard, emotionally, for people to get divorced,"" says matrimonial lawyer Paul Talbert. ""It's harder than just saying we're going to separate and try this out.""

For celebrity couples, there are reputations to be managed. ""For many couples, divorce means public acknowledgement of failure,"" says Dr. Scott Haltzman, therapist and author of several books on marriage.

While those with enough fuel have made the journey by car or truck, others have hitched rides on trailers and donkey carts. Some have even resorted to making the perilous journey on foot.

This kind of mass relocation of civilians amid regular airstrikes was never going to be easy. Both the United Nations and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders dubbed the task ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù citing the logistical nightmare of relocating half of Gaza‚Äôs population‚Äîamong them women, children, and the elderly‚Äîwithout any guarantees for their safety. Indeed, there have been reports by the Financial Times and others of at least one designated safe route out of northern Gaza being subject to an airstrike resulting in as many as 70 deaths. Hamas blames Israel for the attack‚Äîa charge that the IDF denies. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs being done doesn‚Äôt meet the legal standards for what an evacuation should entail,‚Äù Shaina Low, a communications adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council, tells TIME from the NEC‚Äôs office in East Jerusalem. ‚ÄúIt should be orderly; there should be safety.‚Äù Indeed, while Israel may order an evacuation for imperative military reasons or to protect civilians, international law requires that it provides those being displaced with adequate shelter, hygiene, health, safety, and nutrition.

In Gaza, all of these things have been in short supply since Israel began its bombardment of the densely-populated Strip in retaliation for Hamas‚Äôs Oct. 7 massacre, in which militants killed at least 1,400 Israelis.

Now women can terminate a pregnancy only if the women‚Äôs life or health is at risk (including mental health risks with a psychiatric diagnosis) or if there is reasonable suspicion that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

Yet what the law allows is not actually what is happening in practice, as examples from across the country indicate. The consequences of the reproductive-rights rollback have been dire.

Women who have abortions are not prosecuted under the law, but doctors and others who help women terminate pregnancies, up to the point of viability, may face up to three years in prison. If an abortion takes place beyond the point of viability, then the person who aided in the abortion may face up to eight years in prison. 

This creates what many consider a ‚Äúchilling effect,‚Äù as doctors scared of running afoul of the law hesitate to take lifesaving steps for pregnant patients.

But at a routine anatomy scan when she was around 19 weeks pregnant, doctors told Phillips that the fetus had significant problems with its kidney, stomach, bladder, heart, lungs, and brain.

These conditions were ""not compatible with life outside the womb,"" a doctor told Phillips.

But Phillips, who lives in north Tennessee, could not get an abortion in her home state. She had two options: she could continue her pregnancy and put her own health at significant risk, or she could travel out of state to terminate it.

Losing Miley Rose was hard enough. But the more Phillips thought about it, the more enraged she became. Not at the loss of her daughter, but at the Tennessee abortion restrictions that forced her to travel out of state for a procedure she needed to protect her own health.

So she sued the state and is now running for office.

Israeli airstrikes have razed whole districts and put Gaza, home to 2.3 million people, under total siege after blocking water, food, and power supplies. On Tuesday, Gaza's health ministry said Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 770 people and wounded more than 4,000.

The country, known as the nation for start-ups, has low debt, a current account surplus and high foreign exchange reserves.‚Å†

Hamas political official Ezzat El-Reshiq on Friday denied allegations that the group was using the al-Shifa hospital as a shield for its underground military infrastructure, and said the claims have ‚Äúno basis in truth‚Äù.‚Å†

Israeli spokesman Daniel Hagari said earlier that Hamas had ‚Äúturned hospitals into command and control centres and hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders‚Äù. Hagari also accused Hamas of storing fuel for military operations inside hospitals in Gaza.‚Å†

The al-Shifa Medical Complex is the largest medical health institution within the Gaza Strip. Located in Gaza City, it includes three specialised hospitals; the Surgery Hospital, the Internal Medicine Hospital, and the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital.‚Å†

Thousands of Palestinian civilians have sought refuge at the hospital since Israel launched a devastating assault on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel.‚Å†

.‚Å†
The signatories of the letter, which Al Jazeera has seen, say they ‚Äúhardly recognise the values of the EU‚Äù, claiming there is a ‚Äúseeming indifference demonstrated over the past few days by our institution towards the ongoing massacre of civilians in the Gaza Strip, in disregard for human rights and international humanitarian law‚Äù.‚Å†
.‚Å†
They say they are saddened by the Commission‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble standards‚Äù, since it considers the blockade of Ukraine by Russia as an act of terror, while Israel‚Äôs blockade of Gaza is ‚Äúcompletely ignored‚Äù.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúIf Israel does not stop immediately, the whole Gaza Strip and its inhabitants will be erased from the planet,‚Äù the letter read.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúWe urge you [von der Leyen] to call, together with the leaders of the whole Union, for a ceasefire and for the protection of civilian life. This is at the core of the EU existence,‚Äù they said, warning ‚Äúthe EU risks losing all credibility‚Äù.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The letter represents deep divisions within the bloc on how to approach the Israel-Gaza war, which in less than two weeks has killed thousands of people.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The European Commission‚Äôs ‚Äúrecent unfortunate actions or positions seem to give a free hand to the acceleration and the legitimacy of a war crime in the Gaza Strip‚Äù, the letter said.‚Å†
.‚Å†
In Gaza, more than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them children.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúWe would have been proud if the European Union ‚Ä¶ had called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and indiscriminate violence against civilians,‚Äù the letter read.‚Å†

One of Gaza‚Äôs 1,000 Christians, Jahsan never doubted the church was a safe space for him, his pregnant wife and two children aged five and six. The Greek Orthodox church ‚Äì the oldest in the city, located in the Zaytoun neighbourhood ‚Äì has traditionally served as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims during Israel‚Äôs periodic wars against Gaza.‚Å†

By Friday afternoon, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem told Al Jazeera at least 18 people were confirmed to have been killed, including several children.‚Å†

.‚Å†
Josh Paul, a director in the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, wrote in a note published online on Wednesday that the administration of President Joe Biden was repeating the same mistakes Washington has been making for decades.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúThe response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people,‚Äù he wrote.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúI fear we are repeating the same mistakes we have made these past decades, and I decline to be a part of it for longer,‚Äù he said, adding that the Biden administration‚Äôs ‚Äúblind support for one side‚Äù was leading to policy decisions that were ‚Äúshortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse‚Äù.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúI knew it was not without its moral complexity and moral compromises, and I made myself a promise that I would stay for as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do,‚Äù wrote Paul who was involved in arms transfers to US allies for more than 11 years.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúI am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued ‚Äì indeed, expanded and expedited ‚Äì provision of lethal arms to Israel I have reached the end of that bargain,‚Äù he said.‚Å†
.‚Å†
In an interview with The New York Times, Paul also said that ‚Äúcontinuing to give Israel what he described as carte blanche to kill a generation of enemies, only to create a new one, does not ultimately serve the United States‚Äô interests‚Äù.‚Å†
.‚Å†
‚ÄúWhat it leads to is this desire to sort of impose security at any cost, including in cost to the Palestinian civilian population,‚Äù he told the US publication. ‚ÄúAnd that doesn‚Äôt ultimately lead to security.‚Äù‚Å†

‚ÄúCricket has a relatively high barrier to entry compared to most sports, simply due to the level of equipment required to play even a recreational game,‚Äù said Matt Roller, assistant editor at the ESPNCricinfo website. ‚ÄúIn my view, that is the principal reason that football has long been a global sport: All you need is a ball and any small space.‚Äù‚Å†
.‚Å†
Unlike football's FIFA, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has only 12 full members, with dozens of other nations as associate members.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Experts suggest that the future lies in the T20 cricket format and franchise leagues, which have helped the sport spread globally.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Women's cricket and a possible return to the Olympics could also help improve the sport's global footprint.‚Å†

With the economic infrastructure destroyed, buyers are scared, and prices have dropped significantly.‚Å†

""Our main market was Khartoum,"" says farmer Al-Fatih al-Badawi, 54. Without it, trade is at a standstill and the price for his crop is in freefall.‚Å†

The date industry is one of Sudan's most important sectors, employing more than 80 percent of the workforce and accounting for 35-40 percent of gross domestic product. However, the war has left much of the country's land fallow, processing factories have been destroyed and smallholder farmers have no access to financing.‚Å†

Even before the war began, a third of people required humanitarian aid, and the country's farmers struggled to break even.‚Å†

As the war continues, many agricultural workers are joining the exodus, and it is unclear whether they can earn enough to survive in the collapsing date market.‚Å†
