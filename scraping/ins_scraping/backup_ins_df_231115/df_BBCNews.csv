Scientists think they might have an idea now, thanks to a new image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope.
 
It shows a star – called HH212 – coming into existence.
 
HH212 is probably no more than 50,000 years old.
 
And, while the glow from the protostar itself is hidden, you can see pinky-red jets shooting out in polar opposite directions, which is what our Sun would have looked like when it was a similar age.

An Indian software billionaire has sparked a debate in his home country over the number of hours people there should work in a week.
 
In a recent podcast, NR Narayana Murthy - father-in-law of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - said that India’s work productivity was “one of the lowest in the world” and so young people should be willing to work more to help the country’s development.
 
His suggestion? A 70-hour work week.
 
""Unless we improve our work productivity... we will not be able to compete with those countries that have made tremendous progress,” Murthy said.
 
Unsurprisingly, his comments have been divisive, drawing both support and criticism.
