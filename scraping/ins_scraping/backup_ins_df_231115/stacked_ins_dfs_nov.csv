Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri, was built during World War II and has made nearly all the rifle cartridges used by the U.S. military since it pulled out of Vietnam.

The plant, operated by a private contractor with Army oversight, is now one of the country‚Äôs biggest manufacturers of commercial rounds for the popular AR-15, and it remains so even as the U.S. government supplies ammunition to Ukraine.

A vast majority of Lake City rounds sold by retailers have been purchased by law-abiding citizens, including hunters, farmers and target shooters. Some of those people are drawn to the ammunition because it‚Äôs made with the same materials, and often to the same specifications, as the military‚Äôs. Others see the rounds as authentic accessories for their tactical weapons and gear.

But more than one million pages of search warrants, police evidence logs, ballistics reports, forfeiture records and court proceedings compiled by The Times provide a sweeping accounting of how Lake City ammunition, once intended for war, has also cut a criminal path through towns and cities in nearly all 50 states.

The third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday devolved at times into brutal personal attacks as the five candidates onstage tried to discuss high-minded issues from the fate of Social Security to the role of America abroad between cutting asides and provocative insults.

But the debate did address weighty issues: whether a soaring budget deficit required a higher retirement age for access to Social Security and Medicare, how the U.S. should back Israel against Hamas and Ukraine against Russia, and how a president could immediately address the strain of inflation in everyday life.

Ohio collector Jim Jaeger, who privately bought the Ferrari for around $500,000 in 1985, sold the car to an anonymous bidder.

WSJ,CzmFqWDMzkk,2023-11-13 17:47:18,GraphImage,"Nearly three years into an experiment that proponents hoped would spark a nationwide relaxation of drug laws, many in Oregon have turned against the decriminalization initiative known as Measure 110, which passed with 58% support in 2020. ‚Å†
‚Å†
People sprawled on sidewalks and using fentanyl with no fear of consequence have become a common sight in cities such as Eugene and Portland. Business owners and local leaders are upset, but so are liberal voters who hoped decriminalization would lead to more people getting help. In reality, few drug users are taking advantage of new state-funded rehabilitation programs.‚Å†
‚Å†
Change appears likely. A coalition of city officials, police chiefs and district attorneys recently called on the state legislature to recriminalize hard drugs. A measure to do so is in the works for next year‚Äôs ballot. A recent poll found the majority of Oregonians support the idea.‚Å†
‚Å†
The fundamental problem, according to law-enforcement officers and researchers, is that the threat of jail time hasn‚Äôt been replaced with a new incentive for people struggling with addiction to seek treatment.‚Å†
‚Å†
Some 6,000 tickets have been issued for drug possession since decriminalization went into effect in 2021, but just 92 people have called and completed assessments needed to connect them to services, according to the nonprofit that operates the helpline. The only penalty for those who don‚Äôt call is a $100 fine, which is rarely enforced.‚Å†
‚Å†
Advocates of drug decriminalization blame Oregon‚Äôs continued problems on nationwide trends, including the rise of deadly fentanyl and increased homelessness.‚Å†
‚Å†
They say Measure 110 is already succeeding at one of its goals: keeping people out of the criminal-justice system for drug possession. About 4,000 people were arrested for drug offenses in Oregon in 2022, down from 11,000 in 2020.‚Å†

‚Å†
These days, too few people are voluntarily leaving their jobs.‚Å†
‚Å†
Turnover has declined so steeply at some large employers that companies now find themselves over budget on certain teams, requiring leaders to weigh whether to postpone projects or to cut additional staff as the end of year approaches. Other bosses worry about how to keep star employees engaged when there are far fewer vacant positions internally, making it harder to move people into new roles.‚Å†
‚Å†
The decline in quitting would seem a welcome development for bosses who spent years bemoaning high levels of job-hopping and rapidly rising salaries. But some executives said they have been caught by surprise at how quickly the labor-market dynamics flipped, posing new challenges.‚Å†
‚Å†
Morgan Stanley had layoffs in recent months in part because of low attrition within the 80,000-person Wall Street firm, CEO James Gorman said on a call with investors in mid-October.‚Å†
‚Å†
Employers try to accurately predict how many staffers will quit in a given year to help set budgets for teams and establish hiring plans. Software company ServiceNow uses a machine-learning model to anticipate the number of employees it expects will step down each quarter. Voluntary turnover this year has fallen below levels forecast by those models, said Sarah Tilley, senior vice president of global talent. She didn‚Äôt cite specific figures, but attrition among top-performing employees in 2023 is less than half of what it was in 2022.‚Å†

In his spare time, he also tackles another impenetrable riddle of the galaxy: What is the best way to board airplanes?‚Å†
‚Å†
Steffen‚Äôs frustration with the boarding process began with an unpleasant trip to the airport in Seattle, where he waited in many lines. He thought the last one, at the jet bridge, was unnecessary.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúThere should be a solution to this‚Äîno matter how weird it might be,‚Äù the 48-year-old said.‚Å†
‚Å†
His annoyance, which you don‚Äôt have to be an astrophysicist to understand, led him to develop what he says is the optimal boarding strategy.‚Å†
‚Å†
Here‚Äôs how it works: The first person to board a single-aisle jet like a Boeing 737 is the passenger in the window seat of the last row. Say that‚Äôs 30A. The next person would be exactly two rows away in 28A, followed by 26A, 24A and 22A until the window seats in even rows on the right side were full. Next are the window seats in even rows on the left side: 30F, 28F, 26F and so on. Then come window seats in odd rows on the right and left starting from the back. The same patterns apply to middle seats and aisle seats until the last person on board plops into the front row.‚Å†
‚Å†
The idea is to reduce the probability of traffic jams. If the primary bottleneck of the boarding process is people waiting in the aisle, mostly because of how long it takes for others to load their luggage, Steffen‚Äôs fix maximizes the number of passengers stuffing their bags into overhead bins simultaneously. It takes a serial process (one at a time) and makes it parallel (several at a time).‚Å†
‚Å†
Steffen‚Äôs academic theories might be too idealistic to overcome the realities of the business, but it‚Äôs still worth exploring why they work.‚Å†

The influx of young mental-health patients is overcrowding emergency departments and delaying treatment across the country at both specialized children‚Äôs hospitals and general hospitals.

After a mental-health evaluation, Iris, who had just turned 18, was transferred to an adult psychiatric unit at an Albuquerque hospital, where she was discharged after five days with a treatment plan that would have required her to wait months for a psychiatrist.‚Å†

‚Å†
Common tactics include displaying products against a white background rather than in room sets or on models, or photographing items with a perspective that makes them appear bigger than they really are. Dimensions can be hidden deep in the product description, or not included at all.‚Å†

‚Å†
Garment workers in Bangladesh make as little as $3 a day, or about $75 a month. In recent days, tens of thousands have refused to work, calling for the minimum wage to be raised to nearly three times that amount. Demonstrations have spiraled, with factories set ablaze and machines smashed. Some three hundred factories stopped operations.‚Å†
‚Å†
Sewing operator Hamim Shikder, who joined protests, said the roughly $125 a month he earns‚Äîafter 50 hours of overtime‚Äîis spent on his son‚Äôs school fees, increasingly expensive groceries and other essentials. When his wife recently got sick with dengue he had to borrow money for medical bills. ‚ÄúWhatever amount I get, I have to spend,‚Äù he said.‚Å†
‚Å†
The core of the protests, that workers need higher wages to make even a basic living, has drawn widespread support, including from fashion giants H&M, Gap and Zara-parent Inditex, which source from the country. But no one can agree on who should foot the bill.‚Å†
‚Å†
Factory owners in Bangladesh say that for them to hike wages in a big way, Western brands that are their top buyers need to pay more for clothes. Although the big names in fashion publicly support higher pay, in practice they balk when costs go up and threaten to shift their orders to other countries, said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.‚Å†
‚Å†
Western brands say they support a boost in Bangladesh‚Äôs minimum wage, but most haven‚Äôt said by how much. Workers sewing clothes for them often make substantially more than the minimum wage but far less than what unions are demanding and what international organizations that benchmark living-wage standards consider to be enough.‚Å†

Arrests at the Southwest U.S. border of migrants from China, India and other distant countries, including Mauritania and Senegal, tripled to 214,000 during the fiscal year that ended in September from 70,000 in the previous fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Fewer than 19,000 migrants from Asia and Africa were apprehended in the fiscal year ended September 2021.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúThese days, we are dealing with 120 nationalities and 60 different languages,‚Äù said Enrique Lucero, head of the migrant support unit of the Tijuana city government, across from San Diego.‚Å†
‚Å†
Travelers say they exchange information and share videos of U.S.-bound routes on Tik Tok and Facebook, while smugglers offer lodging and travel agencies advertise transport services. Most Asian and African migrants make multiple airport stopovers in what are coming to be known as ‚Äúdonkey flights‚Äù to reach countries such as Brazil, Ecuador or Nicaragua, which have few or no visa requirements for some nationalities. Once they set foot in Latin America, they move north in buses or cars and stay at hotels booked by smuggling organizations.‚Å†
‚Å†
For the second year in a row, arrests by the Border Patrol at the U.S. Southern border surpassed two million. Most of them, almost nine out of 10 apprehensions, are of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. But the surge in so-called extracontinental migrants poses a challenge for the U.S. because deporting migrants to Africa and Asia is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes not possible.‚Å†

Instead, Awad Darawshe helped those wounded in Hamas‚Äôs violent rampage. ‚ÄúIt cost him his life,‚Äù said his sister, Raya Darawshe.‚Å†
‚Å†
The 23-year-old Arab citizen of Israel was working as a medic at an all-night music festival in southern Israel on the morning Hamas militants broke out of the Gaza Strip, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage.‚Å†
‚Å†
While terrified revelers fled, Darawshe stayed to treat the victims and was shot by Hamas, becoming one of more than a dozen Arabs who were killed or captured in the wide-scale attacks.‚Å†
‚Å†
Their deaths illustrate the dilemma facing members of the country‚Äôs Arab minority, as war between Israel and Hamas pulls them between their country and their kin. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were driven from their homes during the war that erupted upon the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Those who remained and their descendants‚Äîcolloquially called ‚Äô48 Arabs‚Äîmake up about 20% of the population and are dubbed Arab-Israelis by the state. They have largely sought integration in Israel and enjoy equal rights on paper, but many say they feel like second-class citizens.‚Å†

American sisters Jana and Mena Timraz rejoiced when their names appeared on the list on Thursday.

Their story is among the tales of heart-rending dilemmas and bureaucratic hurdles emerging from those fleeing Gaza in the past few days. After a weekslong diplomatic wrangle to get the frontier open for foreign nationals and the injured, the task of choosing who goes through is arguably more arduous.‚Å†
‚Å†
The exodus was complicated further by the suspension of crossings on Saturday morning, when Hamas, the U.S.-designated terror organization that runs the Gaza Strip, said it wouldn‚Äôt open the border unless Israel agreed to the safe passage of ambulances heading to the crossing. An ambulance near the largest hospital in Gaza City was struck Friday by the Israelis, who said they were targeting Hamas militants using the vehicle. The border opened again on Monday.‚Å†

About 60 different nations have asked Egypt for around 7,600 foreign nationals‚Äîmany of Palestinian heritage‚Äîto be allowed to leave Gaza, according to senior Egyptian officials.

He snapped it up for ¬£15 plus postage, then turned around and sold it to a collector for a couple of thousand pounds.‚Å†
‚Å†
In the following years, the same seller kept unearthing incredible finds at rock-bottom prices. Gradel inquired as to how he had come across these items.

‚Å†
‚ÄúI wanted to bring to your attention what l believe is a critical gap in how we as a company approach harm, and how the people we serve experience it,‚Äù he began. Though Meta regularly issued public reports suggesting that it was largely on top of safety issues on its platforms, he wrote, the company was deluding itself.‚Å†
‚Å†
The experience of young users on Meta‚Äôs Instagram‚Äîwhere Bejar had spent the previous two years working as a consultant‚Äîwas especially acute. In a subsequent email to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, one statistic stood out: One in eight users under the age of 16 said they had experienced unwanted sexual advances on the platform over the previous seven days.‚Å†
‚Å†
For Bejar, that finding was hardly a surprise. His daughter and her friends had been receiving unsolicited penis pictures and other forms of harassment on the platform since the age of 14, he wrote, and Meta‚Äôs systems generally ignored their reports‚Äîor responded by saying that the harassment didn‚Äôt violate platform rules.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI asked her why boys keep doing that,‚Äù Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg and his top lieutenants. ‚ÄúShe said if the only thing that happens is they get blocked, why wouldn‚Äôt they?‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
For the well-being of its users, Bejar argued, Meta needed to change course, focusing less on a flawed system of rules-based policing and more on addressing such bad experiences. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI am appealing to you because I believe that working this way will require a culture shift,‚Äù Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg‚Äîthe company would have to acknowledge that its existing approach to governing Facebook and Instagram wasn‚Äôt working.‚Å†

Two years later, the problems Bejar identified remain unresolved, and new blind spots have emerged.

So far, few have been large, but residents are on edge: They live on top of a supervolcano, a classification given to about 20 of the world‚Äôs largest volcanoes. The constant earthquakes are a sign of volcanic activity deep underground.‚Å†

Vesuvius, southeast of Naples, which destroyed Pompeii in the first century A.D., is the region‚Äôs most famous volcano. But modern volcanologists are far more worried about the cluster of low-lying craters around Pozzuoli known as Campi Flegrei.

‚ÄúThe absence of a Code, however, has led in recent years to the misunderstanding that the Justices of this Court, unlike all other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules,‚Äù the justices wrote. ‚ÄúTo dispel this misunderstanding, we are issuing this Code, which largely represents a codification of principles that we have long regarded as governing our conduct.‚Äù

Researchers have known for a while that beer production will be affected by climate change, said Mirek Trnka, a professor at the Global Change Research Institute.

His first study on hops 15 years ago issued a similar warning to his latest paper.‚Å†

That‚Äôs why some are working on varieties of hops that can better withstand summer heat, warmer winters, changing pests and diseases and less snowfall, which could mean less available irrigation, said Shaun Townsend, an associate professor and senior researcher at Oregon State University.

Located about half a mile off the southern coast of Iwo Jima, which Japan calls Ioto, the unnamed volcano started its latest series of eruptions on Oct. 21.

Within 10 days, volcanic ash and rocks piled up on the shallow seabed, its tip rising above the sea surface. By early November, it became a new island about 328 feet in diameter and as high as 66 feet above the sea, according to Yuji Usui, an analyst in the Japan Meteorological Agency‚Äôs volcanic division.

Keeping hundreds of sheep, of historically prized Churro and other breeds, used to be the norm for many families living on a vast reservation that straddles parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

But today some families have given up raising them all together. The ones who do report having far fewer sheep, sometimes just a handful. Still, many Navajo shepherds say they will keep their sheep as long as they can, and some younger people are speaking out and finding ways to pass on the tradition.

Nikyle Begay, featured in this set of photos, is vocal about the art of weaving and determined to keep the practice vibrant. In 2020, they started Rainbow Fiber Co-Op, a wool co-op intended to protect ancestral flocks on Navajo Nation and ensure fair prices for shepherds.

The work from former NASA top scientist James Hansen, who since leaving the space agency has become a prominent protester against the use of fossil fuels, which cause climate change, illustrates a recently surfaced division among scientists about whether global warming has kicked into a new and even more dangerous gear.

Hansen, who alerted much of the United States to the harms of climate change in dramatic congressional testimony in 1988, said Thursday that since 2010, the rate of warming has jumped by 50%.

Hansen argues that since 2010 there is more sun energy in the atmosphere, and less of the particles that can reflect it back into space thanks to efforts to cut pollution. The loss of those particles means there‚Äôs less of the cooling effect that they can have.

Several climate scientists contacted by The Associated Press expressed skepticism about Hansen‚Äôs study, tinged with respect for his long-term work.

Hansen‚Äôs study in Thursday‚Äôs journal Oxford Open Climate Change is broad-ranging ‚Äúbut has little by way of analytical depth or consistency checks when making claims quite far outside the norm,‚Äù said Robin Lamboll, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London. ‚ÄúIt seems primarily aimed at convincing policymakers rather than scientists.‚Äù

The Hall of Famer cared little what others thought of him, choosing Frank Sinatra‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù to celebrate his 880th win in 2007, then the record for a Division I men‚Äôs coach.

He was nicknamed ‚ÄúThe General‚Äù and his temper was such that in 2000 it cost him his job at Indiana. He once hit a police officer in Puerto Rico, threw a chair across the court and was accused of wrapping his hands around a player‚Äôs neck.

His critics fumed relentlessly about his conduct, but his defenders were legion. There was this side of Knight as well: He took pride in his players‚Äô high graduation rates, and during a rule-breaking era he never was accused of a major NCAA violation.

AP's Assessment: False. The European airport confirmed it does not have a desk for misguided tourists trying to get Down Under.

The Facts: The notion of a help desk for planeloads of absent-minded holiday makers who set out for Sydney but wound up thousands of miles away in Salzburg has delighted the internet in recent days.

It‚Äôs the kind of fun fact social media users just can‚Äôt resist reposting: So many travelers who intend to visit Australia are accidentally buying tickets to Austria that the country‚Äôs second-largest airport has had to set up a special counter to redirect misguided tourists to the correct continent.

But is it true? The answer, as Australians would say, is ‚Äúnah.‚Äù Or ‚Äúnein‚Äù if you happen to have found yourself in Austria.

Most years, the COP president plays a largely functionary role, shuttling between member countries to find common ground on wonky areas of climate policy. Al Jaber has taken a very different approach. 

He has extended an invitation to oil and gas companies and prioritized private-sector climate solutions. In Al Jaber‚Äôs view, the success of COP28, not to mention the broader efforts to fight climate change, hinges as much on embracing the private sector and shifting market conditions as it does on wonky negotiations. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a paradigm shift,‚Äù he says. 

Critics from Greta Thunberg to Al Gore say Al Jaber is just a stalking horse for the fossil-fuel industry‚Äôs continuing efforts to stall the global climate agenda. 

Al Jaber says he‚Äôs uniquely positioned to reconcile the many interests in the climate fight. That debate will define the coming COP summit.

‚ÄúIt may or may not work,‚Äù says John Kerry, President Biden‚Äôs climate envoy. ‚ÄúSome might call it an experiment to have an oil-and-gas-¬≠producing entity host COP. That‚Äôs the big question.‚Äù

The conditions for medical care in Gaza are deteriorating.

His sobering pitch is that Japan‚Äôs economy is teetering on a precipice because of an unhealthy obsession with manufacturing, workers conditioned to corporate bloat, and a budget financed by soaring debt rather than tax receipts.

Yanai is putting his money where his mouth is and in March hiked the wages of his 8,400 or so employees in Japan by up to 40%.

In office since 2009, after an earlier term from 1996 to 2001, she is the world‚Äôs longest-serving female head of government and credited with subduing both resurgent Islamists and a once meddlesome military. 

Hasina is determined to extend that run at the ballot box in January. ‚ÄúI am confident that my people are with me,‚Äù she says in an interview with TIME in September. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre my main strength.‚Äù

Few rebuttals are as stark as the 19 assassination attempts that Hasina has weathered over the years. In recent months, supporters of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have clashed with security forces, leading to hundreds of arrests, police vehicles and public buses set ablaze, and several people killed. 

Bangladesh has taken an authoritarian turn under Hasina‚Äôs Awami League party. The last two elections were condemned by the U.S., E.U. and others for significant irregularities, including stuffed ballot boxes and thousands of phantom voters. (She won 84% and 82% of the vote, respectively.) 

Meanwhile, BNP workers have been hit by a staggering 4 million legal cases, while independent journalists and civil society also complain of vindictive harassment. Critics say January‚Äôs vote is tantamount to a coronation and Hasina to a dictator. 

What would a fourth straight term for Hasina mean for Bangladesh? Read the cover story at the link in bio.

At a time when dynasties traditionally dominated Indonesia‚Äôs political arena, the ascension of Jokowi, who was a carpenter and furniture businessman before becoming the governor of Jakarta, was hailed as a beacon of hope. 

But as the curtains fall on Jokowi‚Äôs decade of rule, he may be remembered more for ushering in a new era of democratic decline. Even his capstone initiative, what was meant to be a sprawling monument to his legacy‚Äîthe development of a new capital called Nusantara, to replace the existing capital in Jakarta beginning as soon as next year‚Äîlooks to embody such a backsliding.

In response, the government announced a 1.8-billion-euro programme to help young couples buy their first home. However, the scheme has been criticised for being poorly designed and for not providing enough support to those who need it.‚Å†

The country‚Äôs #tourism industry, which has been a major economic success, has also contributed to worsening the demographic problem by restoring real estate value lost during the economic depression and putting first homes out of the reach of young people.‚Å†

The population has been shrinking since the turn of the century, and the birth rate has fallen by 30% since 2011, making it difficult for Greece to generate state revenue and support its ageing population.‚Å†

The demand for Darjeeling tea in India has fallen due to the availability of cheaper alternatives from #Nepal and rising production costs, endangering the industry and the livelihoods of thousands of workers.‚Å†

The Darjeeling tea industry was started by the British in the mid-19th century and now has 87 tea gardens in India's West Bengal state.‚Å†

The premium quality tea caters mostly to international markets, but exports to Russia, Japan, Iran, the US, and European countries have declined in the past five years.‚Å†

.‚Å†
Commissioned by the Grand Admiral and built by renowned architect Mimar Sinan around 1530, the so-called ‚ÄúTiled Bathhouse‚Äù was a pinnacle of architectural splendour and sophistication in the city, famous for its distinctive blue and white Iznik tiles.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The intervening centuries had not been kind to the long-forgotten marvel. As the Ottoman Empire gave way to the increasingly Westernised Turkey of the 18th and 19th centuries, sensibilities moved away from older traditions, such as hammams, causing many ‚Äì including Cinili Hamam ‚Äì to fall into disrepair.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Many of its fixtures ‚Äì including its eponymous tiles ‚Äì were stripped away to be sold to international museums and private collectors, leaving behind a hollow shell.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Now, after a long and ambitious 13-year restoration effort, this lost treasure has been revitalised through the efforts of the Marmara Group and is once more a place of cleansing and relaxation, but also one that reflects much of Turkey‚Äôs hidden history.‚Å†

His photographs are reminiscent of Renaissance or Baroque paintings and are often based on parables. Sexual tension is ever-present in Nes‚Äô work, as he delves into complex explorations of homoeroticism. ‚Å†

‚ÄúMy staged photographs are oversized and often recall well-known scenes from Art History and Western Civilization combined with personal experiences based on my life as a gay youth growing up in a small town on the periphery of Israeli society,‚Äù said Nes.‚Å†

Even though soldiers are his most common subject, Nes‚Äôs photographs subvert the stereotype and tropes of the hyper-masculine, jingoistic Israeli soldier. ‚ÄúI allowed my subjects to be sensitive, childlike and anxious,‚Äù he says. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúBefore starting work on the Soldiers series, I decided my subjects would never be in combat,‚Äù Nes has also said. ‚ÄúThey would always be in between. They eat, sleep, take a piss, but they never fight. Still, death is always present, lingering.
