The official said soldiers found weapons and other “concrete evidence” that militants had been operating in the hospital but didn’t elaborate, adding that the evidence would be shared later with the public.⁠

⁠
Meta made the change last year, but it hasn’t gained wide attention. The company decided to allow political advertisers to say past elections were “rigged” or “stolen” but prevented them from questioning the legitimacy of ongoing and coming elections.⁠
⁠
Executives at Meta made the decision based on free-speech considerations after weighing past U.S. elections in which the results might have been contested by a portion of the electorate, according to people familiar with the issue.⁠
⁠
The updated policy is part of a number of changes Meta has made that might fundamentally alter its influence and reach compared with past elections, including a move to adjust its algorithm in a way that de-emphasizes organic political content on Facebook, the people said.⁠
⁠
Some candidates already appear to have questioned elections in ads. Former President Donald Trump ran a campaign ad on Facebook in August that was within the bounds of the updated policy. “We won in 2016. We had a rigged election in 2020 but got more votes than any sitting president,” Trump said in the ad. “We’re going to win like never before.”⁠

⁠
RM Sotheby’s sold the car for $52 million on Monday, below its $60 million asking price. The top-selling car is a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe, a prototype that was auctioned for $142 million last year and one of two ever manufactured. ⁠
⁠
Ohio collector Jim Jaeger, who privately bought the Ferrari for around $500,000 in 1985, sold the car to an anonymous bidder. The Ferrari was one of 34 produced by Ferrari and one of only two GTO models ever raced by Ferrari’s own team, Scuderia Ferrari, the auction house said. It initially sold in 1964 for about $6,000, Sotheby’s said.⁠
⁠
The auction house made the unusual move of using the car as part of its high-profile New York series of fall auctions—bidding began just before its evening sale of modern art—as a way to underscore the fact that collectors are now willing to pay as much for a vintage vehicle as they would a masterpiece painting.⁠

WSJ,CzmFqWDMzkk,2023-11-13 17:47:18,GraphImage,"Nearly three years into an experiment that proponents hoped would spark a nationwide relaxation of drug laws, many in Oregon have turned against the decriminalization initiative known as Measure 110, which passed with 58% support in 2020. ⁠
⁠
People sprawled on sidewalks and using fentanyl with no fear of consequence have become a common sight in cities such as Eugene and Portland. Business owners and local leaders are upset, but so are liberal voters who hoped decriminalization would lead to more people getting help. In reality, few drug users are taking advantage of new state-funded rehabilitation programs.⁠
⁠
Change appears likely. A coalition of city officials, police chiefs and district attorneys recently called on the state legislature to recriminalize hard drugs. A measure to do so is in the works for next year’s ballot. A recent poll found the majority of Oregonians support the idea.⁠
⁠
The fundamental problem, according to law-enforcement officers and researchers, is that the threat of jail time hasn’t been replaced with a new incentive for people struggling with addiction to seek treatment.⁠
⁠
Some 6,000 tickets have been issued for drug possession since decriminalization went into effect in 2021, but just 92 people have called and completed assessments needed to connect them to services, according to the nonprofit that operates the helpline. The only penalty for those who don’t call is a $100 fine, which is rarely enforced.⁠
⁠
Advocates of drug decriminalization blame Oregon’s continued problems on nationwide trends, including the rise of deadly fentanyl and increased homelessness.⁠
⁠
They say Measure 110 is already succeeding at one of its goals: keeping people out of the criminal-justice system for drug possession. About 4,000 people were arrested for drug offenses in Oregon in 2022, down from 11,000 in 2020.⁠

WSJ,CzkSbXJLnpu,2023-11-13 01:00:27,GraphImage,"The white-collar labor market is softening to a point that companies are encountering an issue that would have been unthinkable in the era known as the Great Resignation. ⁠
⁠
These days, too few people are voluntarily leaving their jobs.⁠
⁠
Turnover has declined so steeply at some large employers that companies now find themselves over budget on certain teams, requiring leaders to weigh whether to postpone projects or to cut additional staff as the end of year approaches. Other bosses worry about how to keep star employees engaged when there are far fewer vacant positions internally, making it harder to move people into new roles.⁠
⁠
The decline in quitting would seem a welcome development for bosses who spent years bemoaning high levels of job-hopping and rapidly rising salaries. But some executives said they have been caught by surprise at how quickly the labor-market dynamics flipped, posing new challenges.⁠
⁠
Morgan Stanley had layoffs in recent months in part because of low attrition within the 80,000-person Wall Street firm, CEO James Gorman said on a call with investors in mid-October.⁠
⁠
Employers try to accurately predict how many staffers will quit in a given year to help set budgets for teams and establish hiring plans. Software company ServiceNow uses a machine-learning model to anticipate the number of employees it expects will step down each quarter. Voluntary turnover this year has fallen below levels forecast by those models, said Sarah Tilley, senior vice president of global talent. She didn’t cite specific figures, but attrition among top-performing employees in 2023 is less than half of what it was in 2022.⁠

WSJ,CzjwRbZvt3Y,2023-11-12 20:03:59,GraphVideo,"Astrophysicist Jason Steffen has spent his career trying to crack the deepest mysteries of the universe while studying exoplanets orbiting distant stars, dark matter and gravitation. In his spare time, he also tackles another impenetrable riddle of the galaxy: What is the best way to board airplanes?⁠
⁠
Steffen’s frustration with the boarding process began with an unpleasant trip to the airport in Seattle, where he waited in many lines. He thought the last one, at the jet bridge, was unnecessary.⁠
⁠
“There should be a solution to this—no matter how weird it might be,” the 48-year-old said.⁠
⁠
His annoyance, which you don’t have to be an astrophysicist to understand, led him to develop what he says is the optimal boarding strategy.⁠
⁠
Here’s how it works: The first person to board a single-aisle jet like a Boeing 737 is the passenger in the window seat of the last row. Say that’s 30A. The next person would be exactly two rows away in 28A, followed by 26A, 24A and 22A until the window seats in even rows on the right side were full. Next are the window seats in even rows on the left side: 30F, 28F, 26F and so on. Then come window seats in odd rows on the right and left starting from the back. The same patterns apply to middle seats and aisle seats until the last person on board plops into the front row.⁠
⁠
The idea is to reduce the probability of traffic jams. If the primary bottleneck of the boarding process is people waiting in the aisle, mostly because of how long it takes for others to load their luggage, Steffen’s fix maximizes the number of passengers stuffing their bags into overhead bins simultaneously. It takes a serial process (one at a time) and makes it parallel (several at a time).⁠
⁠
Steffen’s academic theories might be too idealistic to overcome the realities of the business, but it’s still worth exploring why they work.⁠

⁠
The increased demand for treatment exacerbated a shortage of available mental-health services. This has left desperate families pouring into emergency departments that legally can turn no one away. ⁠
⁠
The influx of young mental-health patients is overcrowding emergency departments and delaying treatment across the country at both specialized children’s hospitals and general hospitals. Major pediatric and emergency medicine organizations issued a public warning to hospitals and doctors in August, stating that the lack of space and available staff is forcing children who need psychiatric care to wait too long in E.R.s. ⁠
⁠
Andrea Teague, an oncologist in Santa Fe, N.M., has struggled to get help for her teenage daughter Iris, who suffers from depression and an eating disorder. The lone therapist Teague knew of in Santa Fe specializing in adolescent eating disorders had a six-month wait list. An Albuquerque program was temporarily closed. ⁠
⁠
Teague eventually found residential facilities, but it took weeks to get her in. After being discharged from one facility, Iris tried to kill herself. After a mental-health evaluation, Iris, who had just turned 18, was transferred to an adult psychiatric unit at an Albuquerque hospital, where she was discharged after five days with a treatment plan that would have required her to wait months for a psychiatrist.⁠
⁠
Teague used her medical connections to cobble together a treatment plan, which includes a local therapist and a dietitian from Colorado who helps her daughter remotely. ⁠
⁠
“She was in a crisis that required relatively urgent intervention, where waiting meant putting her life in danger,” Teague said. ⁠

⁠
Other cars designed by her father include the Lil Redd Wrecker, a build he made for the Redd Foxx TV show “Sanford and Son,” and a hot rod mail carrier called the Zip Code Mail Truck. He also worked on the Macabre Mobile from the 1988 film “Elvira: Mistress of the Dark.”⁠
⁠
Barris, aka the “King of the Kustomizers,” started out in the 1950s and moved to Los Angeles when hid designs started gaining popularity. In the mid-1960s, a producer asked him to build a car for a new TV series called “Batman.” The studio gave him 15 days to build a Batmobile, Barris-Paster says.⁠
⁠
“When my father first saw the 1966 TV Batmobile coming out of the Bat Cave on the set, he thought: ‘You can’t see the car. It’s too dark.’ So he painted the red-orange stripes,” she said. ⁠
⁠
Today, Barris-Paster keeps some of her father’s show cars in a private space in Los Angeles and others at a shop in Ventura County, Calif., shown here. ⁠
⁠
“We do not drive these cars much, but when we take them to car shows or charity events, it amazes me the way people react to them,” she said. “These cars bring so much joy, which is what drove my father to keep creating them.”⁠

⁠
Emma Platt, 41, a U.K.-based graphic designer, bought a set of coat hangers labeled as “small” from the Chinese fashion site Shein for her part-time business selling secondhand children’s clothes.⁠
⁠
“I probably couldn’t fit anything but Barbie clothes on there,” Platt said of the mini hangers that arrived. ⁠
⁠
It turns out it’s not uncommon. Online marketplaces sell tiny pink cowboy hats. They also sell miniature pencil sharpeners, palm-size kitchen utensils, scaled-down books and itsy-bitsy camping chairs. Many of the minuscule objects aren’t clearly advertised.⁠
⁠
Shoppers have gotten lazy when clicking “buy” and assume—often wrongly—what size they’re getting, said Brendan Witcher, a principal analyst at research and advisory firm Forrester. But there is no doubt some online sellers deliberately trick customers into buying smaller and often cheaper-to-produce items, he said.⁠
⁠
Common tactics include displaying products against a white background rather than in room sets or on models, or photographing items with a perspective that makes them appear bigger than they really are. Dimensions can be hidden deep in the product description, or not included at all.⁠
⁠
In those instances, the duped consumer “may say, well, it’s only $1, $2, maybe $3—what’s the harm?” Witcher said. When the item arrives the shopper may be confused, amused or frustrated, but unlikely to complain or demand a refund.⁠

⁠
The cost of admissions and fees for entertainment rose faster than the cost of many staple goods last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That has helped raise standards for the amount of fun we expect for our money—and triggered quick disappointment when our experiences don’t live up to the price. ⁠
⁠
Someone who scores cheap flights to Europe may give the trip five stars before the plane even boards. Someone who spends half their paycheck on playoff tickets may get cranky about it by halftime. ⁠
⁠
And people are spending for now. Corie Barry, Best Buy’s CEO, said at a conference last month that “experiences are really where people are willing to pay” and that this was dragging on demand for expensive electronics. ⁠
⁠
Studies on money and happiness tell us that paying for experiences tends to bring us greater pleasures than buying stuff, because those experiences can deliver payoffs before, during and after they happen. ⁠
⁠
Dissatisfaction is more likely when money is tighter, a 2022 study in the Journal of Consumer Research found. People feel worse about purchases of both things and experiences and write more negative reviews, researchers found. This regret often stems from thinking about all the other ways the money could have been used instead.⁠

⁠
Garment workers in Bangladesh make as little as $3 a day, or about $75 a month. In recent days, tens of thousands have refused to work, calling for the minimum wage to be raised to nearly three times that amount. Demonstrations have spiraled, with factories set ablaze and machines smashed. Some three hundred factories stopped operations.⁠
⁠
Sewing operator Hamim Shikder, who joined protests, said the roughly $125 a month he earns—after 50 hours of overtime—is spent on his son’s school fees, increasingly expensive groceries and other essentials. When his wife recently got sick with dengue he had to borrow money for medical bills. “Whatever amount I get, I have to spend,” he said.⁠
⁠
The core of the protests, that workers need higher wages to make even a basic living, has drawn widespread support, including from fashion giants H&M, Gap and Zara-parent Inditex, which source from the country. But no one can agree on who should foot the bill.⁠
⁠
Factory owners in Bangladesh say that for them to hike wages in a big way, Western brands that are their top buyers need to pay more for clothes. Although the big names in fashion publicly support higher pay, in practice they balk when costs go up and threaten to shift their orders to other countries, said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.⁠
⁠
Western brands say they support a boost in Bangladesh’s minimum wage, but most haven’t said by how much. Workers sewing clothes for them often make substantially more than the minimum wage but far less than what unions are demanding and what international organizations that benchmark living-wage standards consider to be enough.⁠

Arrests at the Southwest U.S. border of migrants from China, India and other distant countries, including Mauritania and Senegal, tripled to 214,000 during the fiscal year that ended in September from 70,000 in the previous fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.

Travelers say they exchange information and share videos of U.S.-bound routes on Tik Tok and Facebook, while smugglers offer lodging and travel agencies advertise transport services. Most Asian and African migrants make multiple airport stopovers in what are coming to be known as “donkey flights” to reach countries such as Brazil, Ecuador or Nicaragua, which have few or no visa requirements for some nationalities. Once they set foot in Latin America, they move north in buses or cars and stay at hotels booked by smuggling organizations.⁠
⁠
For the second year in a row, arrests by the Border Patrol at the U.S. Southern border surpassed two million. Most of them, almost nine out of 10 apprehensions, are of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean.

The 23-year-old Arab citizen of Israel was working as a medic at an all-night music festival in southern Israel on the morning Hamas militants broke out of the Gaza Strip, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage.⁠

While terrified revelers fled, Darawshe stayed to treat the victims and was shot by Hamas, becoming one of more than a dozen Arabs who were killed or captured in the wide-scale attacks.⁠

Their deaths illustrate the dilemma facing members of the country’s Arab minority, as war between Israel and Hamas pulls them between their country and their kin. ⁠

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were driven from their homes during the war that erupted upon the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Those who remained and their descendants—colloquially called ’48 Arabs—make up about 20% of the population and are dubbed Arab-Israelis by the state. They have largely sought integration in Israel and enjoy equal rights on paper, but many say they feel like second-class citizens.⁠

“Whenever there is a war or anything, it comes back against us as ’48 Arabs,” said Darawshe’s sister.⁠

American sisters Jana and Mena Timraz rejoiced when their names appeared on the list on Thursday. But their parents, brothers and Jana’s husband, who aren’t U.S. citizens, were missing from the roster. “My husband said ‘Go save yourself and son—that’s the most important thing,’” recalls Jana, cradling her 3-month-old son in a hotel in Cairo, having left the rest of her family behind in Gaza.⁠

Their story is among the tales of heart-rending dilemmas and bureaucratic hurdles emerging from those fleeing Gaza in the past few days. After a weekslong diplomatic wrangle to get the frontier open for foreign nationals and the injured, the task of choosing who goes through is arguably more arduous.⁠

The exodus was complicated further by the suspension of crossings on Saturday morning, when Hamas, the U.S.-designated terror organization that runs the Gaza Strip, said it wouldn’t open the border unless Israel agreed to the safe passage of ambulances heading to the crossing. An ambulance near the largest hospital in Gaza City was struck Friday by the Israelis, who said they were targeting Hamas militants using the vehicle. The border opened again on Monday.⁠

About 60 different nations have asked Egypt for around 7,600 foreign nationals—many of Palestinian heritage—to be allowed to leave Gaza, according to senior Egyptian officials. Among them are between 500 and 600 Americans. In its first three days of operation, some 1,027 dual nationals went through the crossing. On Saturday, though, departures dried up altogether, before being restored on Monday, when 329 civilians went through.

Jewish employees such as Alyssa Bleser, chief legal officer at a cannabis company, say they’re troubled by rising antisemitism and feeling alienated and unsupported by the lack of response from co-workers and bosses. “I would like to see my non-Jewish colleagues and friends speak up,” says Bleser.⁠
⁠
After her 11-year-old daughter was told by a classmate that she and other Jews should die, Bleser emailed her CEO a statement she’d written in support of Israel, suggesting he circulate it among investors. ⁠
⁠
The CEO, Jonathan Morrison, didn’t circulate the statement but later invited Bleser and her husband to discuss the conflict. He says he prefers to show support to his Jewish colleagues one-on-one, adding that it feels more meaningful that way.⁠
⁠
Many company leaders are taking a similar route, given the fraught, complex history between Israel and the Palestinians and the sense that there is no right thing to say. “CEOs, they’re like, nuh-uh, not getting dragged into this one,” says Johnny C. Taylor Jr., head of the human-resources professional association SHRM.⁠
⁠
Speaking out at work, or outside it, can exact a professional toll, workers say. Some people who’ve shared views publicly have lost jobs. Workers from California to Chicago say in interviews that they believed they’ve been reported to their employers for voicing pro-Palestinian sentiment online. ⁠

WSJ,CzRuiW2M2DC,2023-11-05 20:00:32,GraphImage,"When girls at Westfield High School in New Jersey found out boys were sharing nude photos of them in group chats, they were shocked, and not only because it was an invasion of privacy. The images weren’t real.⁠
⁠
Students said one or more classmates used an online tool powered by artificial intelligence to make the images, then shared them with others. The discovery has sparked uproar in Westfield, an affluent town outside New York City.⁠
⁠
Digitally altered or faked images and videos have exploded along with the availability of free or cheap AI tools. While celebrity likenesses from Oprah Winfrey to Pope Francis have drawn media attention, the overwhelming majority of faked images are pornographic, experts say.⁠
⁠
The lack of clarity on such images’ legality—and how or whether to punish their makers—has parents, schools and law enforcement running to catch up as AI speeds ahead.⁠
⁠
Some Westfield parents said their daughters have felt humiliated and powerless, and worry about damage to the girls should the images surface later. And they are upset that no resolution is forthcoming.⁠
⁠
Even among parents, there is no consensus. Some called for harsh punishment for whoever created the images. Others deemed it a youthful transgression that should be forgiven.⁠
⁠
The debate and its aftermath are likely to continue for months. Westfield police are investigating, and a state senator has asked county prosecutors to look into the case.⁠

WSJ,CzRTEiwM-we,2023-11-05 16:00:31,GraphImage,"Ittai Gradel, an academic–turned–gem dealer in Denmark, was trawling eBay a decade ago when he thought he had stumbled across a gold mine.⁠
⁠
Gradel saw a seller advertising a glass gem from the 19th century. Gradel immediately recognized it as something much more valuable: an agate Roman Medusa cameo from the second century. He snapped it up for £15 plus postage, then turned around and sold it to a collector for a couple of thousand pounds.⁠
⁠
In the following years, the same seller kept unearthing incredible finds at rock-bottom prices. Gradel inquired as to how he had come across these items. The seller said he had acquired them from his grandfather, who died in 1953. The oddly credible backstory left Gradel comfortable that he had encountered every dealer’s dream seller. ⁠
⁠
Then, in 2016, the seller posted a piece on eBay by mistake. Intrigued by the item, Gradel screenshotted it. But the seller quickly removed it from the website and said that it actually belonged to his sister, who didn’t want to sell it. ⁠
⁠
Gradel thought not much more about it. But in 2020, he came across an image on the British Museum’s website that showed the exact same item in its collection. Furthermore, the color photograph was recent. It suddenly dawned on Gradel: There was a thief in the British Museum. “And he was likely still within the walls,” he says.⁠
⁠
So began an antiques whodunit that has shaken the premise behind the museum’s most important reason for existing: that it is the best place to safely house some of the world’s greatest treasures. ⁠

⁠
Even while she explores new emotional depths in her work, she can’t help but find the funny. The comedy icon is bringing her singular point of view to more serious projects involving questions of marital strife, family tragedy and the wisdom of older women. The turn reflects, in part, where she is in her life right now.⁠
⁠
“I have a lot of experience and I can bring it to bear,” @officialjld tells @wsjmag. “And I’m really interested in trying new things.”⁠
⁠
It’s been five years since Louis-Dreyfus finished treatment for stage-two breast cancer. She used to feel immortal, she says, but not anymore. With the relief of remission comes a determination to make her next years count.⁠
⁠
Louis-Dreyfus’s latest project is “Wiser Than Me,” her first podcast and her most personally revealing work yet. At 62, she is still in her second act but eager to learn about the third, bringing on guests such as designer Diane von Furstenberg, 76, singer Darlene Love, 82, and comedy icon Carol Burnett, 90.⁠

The old ladies are talking, she’s listening, and the show’s a hit.⁠

WSJ,CzO8DogJSqZ,2023-11-04 18:00:47,GraphSidecar,"In the fall of 2021, a consultant named Arturo Bejar sent Meta Platforms Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg an unusual note.⁠
⁠
“I wanted to bring to your attention what l believe is a critical gap in how we as a company approach harm, and how the people we serve experience it,” he began. Though Meta regularly issued public reports suggesting that it was largely on top of safety issues on its platforms, he wrote, the company was deluding itself.⁠
⁠
The experience of young users on Meta’s Instagram—where Bejar had spent the previous two years working as a consultant—was especially acute. In a subsequent email to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, one statistic stood out: One in eight users under the age of 16 said they had experienced unwanted sexual advances on the platform over the previous seven days.⁠
⁠
For Bejar, that finding was hardly a surprise. His daughter and her friends had been receiving unsolicited penis pictures and other forms of harassment on the platform since the age of 14, he wrote, and Meta’s systems generally ignored their reports—or responded by saying that the harassment didn’t violate platform rules.⁠
⁠
“I asked her why boys keep doing that,” Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg and his top lieutenants. “She said if the only thing that happens is they get blocked, why wouldn’t they?”⁠
⁠
For the well-being of its users, Bejar argued, Meta needed to change course, focusing less on a flawed system of rules-based policing and more on addressing such bad experiences. ⁠
⁠
“I am appealing to you because I believe that working this way will require a culture shift,” Bejar wrote to Zuckerberg—the company would have to acknowledge that its existing approach to governing Facebook and Instagram wasn’t working.⁠
⁠
Two years later, the problems Bejar identified remain unresolved, and new blind spots have emerged. The company launched a sizable child-safety task force in June, following revelations that Instagram was cultivating connections among large-scale networks of pedophilic users, an issue the company says it’s working to address.⁠

WSJ,CzOhGFSuKLi,2023-11-04 14:05:42,GraphVideo,"Pozzuoli, a seaside town about 8 miles west of Naples, has had more than 2,500 earthquake tremors in the past three months. So far, few have been large, but residents are on edge: They live on top of a supervolcano, a classification given to about 20 of the world’s largest volcanoes. The constant earthquakes are a sign of volcanic activity deep underground.⁠
⁠
Vesuvius, southeast of Naples, which destroyed Pompeii in the first century A.D., is the region’s most famous volcano. But modern volcanologists are far more worried about the cluster of low-lying craters around Pozzuoli known as Campi Flegrei. The 80-square-mile depression is home to more than a dozen conical volcanoes, several crater lakes—and half a million residents. Another 800,000 people live just outside the depression.⁠
⁠
“It’s nonstop earthquakes here,” said Luca Averna, a part-time fisherman, during a recent 3.6-magnitude tremor. “We’re used to it, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t afraid.”⁠
⁠
In Campi Flegrei, like in Yellowstone and the world’s other supervolcanoes, the probability of a catastrophic eruption is low but not nil, said Alessandro Iannace, a geology professor at the University of Naples Federico II who wrote a popular geology book.⁠
⁠
“The difference is that in Yellowstone, if you think the eruption is coming, you can send the tourists home and close the park for four years,” said Iannace. “You can’t do that with Campi Flegrei. There are just too many people there.”⁠
⁠
An eruption in Campi Flegrei isn’t imminent, but earthquakes have weakened the volcano, making a rupture in the crust more likely, according to a recent study by researchers at Italy’s national institute and University College London.⁠

⁠
The verdict, delivered by a New York federal jury, capped the stunning fall of the onetime crypto king, whose shaggy-haired boy-genius persona helped catapult FTX into a powerhouse trading platform that sponsored sports teams and ran glitzy ads featuring football great Tom Brady, model Gisele Bündchen and comedian Larry David.
⁠
The crypto exchange abruptly crashed a year ago, with customers losing billions of dollars. Bankman-Fried, 31, was indicted in December 2022 and agreed to leave his home in the Bahamas to face an array of fraud charges. Near the end of the monthlong trial, Bankman-Fried took the risky move of testifying in his own defense.⁠

⁠
The 34-year-old, born Solána Rowe, has been churning out intimate, thorny, genre-blending hits about self-love and self-loathing since she signed to the rap label Top Dawg Entertainment in 2013.⁠
⁠
Her debut album, “Ctrl,” hasn’t left the Billboard 200 chart since July 2017. Her follow-up, “SOS,” dropped in December 2022; its 10 weeks on the chart made it the longest-running No. 1 album by a female artist of the decade. It also broke a record for most weeks atop the R&B chart.⁠
⁠
The five years between “Ctrl” and “SOS” elevated @sza to superstar status. She became more famous by being less present. Her fans are ravenous, rushing to stream her music and selling out dates on her first headline arena tour.⁠
⁠
Meanwhile, she’s obsessive about the music, and she takes every song personally. “I’ll die about that s—t every time,” she says. Everyone wants more songs, faster, now. SZA insists on taking her time.⁠
⁠
“When I leave the studio, I feel better and empty,” she says. “There’s no better sleep than empty-brain sleep, and that can only come after I’ve been in the studio for 10 hours and done something good in there.”⁠
⁠
Though her circuitous problems—love, heartbreak, ghosting, getting ghosted—have become signature subjects, she says she wants to write about the good stuff, too. “I go through so many other moments in life that are amazing, things that I could never describe,” she says. “I haven’t even tried to find words for those things.”⁠

⁠
Not quite business class and definitely not coach, premium-economy cabins are hooking travelers willing to treat themselves to extra comfort for about double the price of a coach seat on some flights.⁠
⁠
With offerings labeled Premium Plus, Premium Select or Premium Economy, airlines are expanding these sections, which typically come with roomy seats, early boarding, free alcohol and better meals. Airlines say they appeal to travelers with more disposable income, especially on long-haul flights where business-class seats can run thousands of dollars more.⁠
⁠
“I refer to it as an upper-middle cabin for the upper-middle class,” says Jay Sorensen, an industry consultant and president of IdeaWorksCompany. These sections appeal to travelers on work trips with budget-conscious employers, and vacationers who want some comforts without shelling out for business class.⁠
⁠
For flights to Europe from the U.S., round-trip tickets in the premium-economy cabin average about double the cost of main-cabin tickets, according to a fare analysis conducted by IdeaWorksCompany. Business-class seats on those routes are roughly double the cost of premium-economy seats, the analysis found.⁠
⁠
Travelers who do the math on upgrades say the decision depends on the costs, which can vary depending on demand and time of purchase. Customers also factor in flight length, whom they are traveling with and how much legroom they need. ⁠

⁠
The nation’s infant-mortality rate rose 3% from 2021 to 2022, reversing a decadeslong overall decline, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. The rate increased from 5.44 infant deaths for every 1,000 births to 5.6 in 2022, a statistically significant uptick.⁠
⁠
The U.S. rate is double that of many developed countries. Globally, baby death rates have fallen for decades, though five countries that have reported their rates this year recorded increases for last year.⁠
⁠
The death rate for women who give birth has also been rising in the U.S. Researchers who study the issues said the pair of trends indicate more women giving birth are facing challenges getting proper care.⁠

The health of the mother is closely linked to the risks to tiny infants. Complications during pregnancy was one of the fastest-rising causes of infant death, the CDC said, along with dangerous bacterial infections called sepsis.⁠

⁠
Together, the colleagues feasted at Ramadan and lighted candles for Hanukkah. They visited one another’s homes and attended the weddings and funerals of their co-workers’ family members. Throughout past conflicts in the region, they have called their workplace an “island of peace.” ⁠
⁠
That harmony is now being tested.⁠
⁠
SodaStream’s presence in the region has put it in the middle of controversy over the years. A prior SodaStream factory, located in the West Bank, sparked calls for a boycott of the brand.⁠
⁠
The current factory is in the Negev Desert in southern Israel. The Gaza border is about 20 miles away. Before the Hamas terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, the SodaStream facility had about 1,500 employees, roughly a third of them Bedouin. More than 100 were Palestinians bused in every day from the West Bank. ⁠
⁠
The factory is now operating with about two-thirds of its usual staff, the company said. At least one SodaStream employee has been killed, and one has been taken hostage. Other staffers have lost close family members.⁠
⁠
SodaStream was founded more than a century ago in the U.K. and later moved to Israel. PepsiCo bought the business in 2018. SodaStream has weathered past Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, but this crisis is different from any the company has faced before.⁠
