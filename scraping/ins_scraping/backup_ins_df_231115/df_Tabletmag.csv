Tabletmag,CzpNRchrRdh,2023-11-14 22:53:26,GraphVideo,"The last thing Anat Moshe Shoshany heard from her 72-year-old grandmother, Adina, was a text saying that armed men were forcing their way into her house in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The last she saw of her was a clip from social media of her grandmother forced onto a motorcycle and driven away by members of Hamas. 

When her family arrived at their house, they found that the terrorists had killed Adina‚Äôs beloved husband, Anat‚Äôs grandfather David, as he tried to protect her. His body laid on the ground near where he fought bravely to hold the door closed. 

We met Anat at the rally in Washington DC and asked her about what her grandparents were like before their lives were torn apart by terror.",2801,92

Tabletmag,CzeKIMBMEgw,2023-11-10 15:52:22,GraphSidecar,"Shabbat spotlight: The photos of Adi Nes, the acclaimed Israeli photographer whose work is both autobiographical and representative of life in a turbulent country. His photographs are reminiscent of Renaissance or Baroque paintings and are often based on parables. Sexual tension is ever-present in Nes‚Äô work, as he delves into complex explorations of homoeroticism. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúMy staged photographs are oversized and often recall well-known scenes from Art History and Western Civilization combined with personal experiences based on my life as a gay youth growing up in a small town on the periphery of Israeli society,‚Äù said Nes.‚Å†
‚Å†
Even though soldiers are his most common subject, Nes‚Äôs photographs subvert the stereotype and tropes of the hyper-masculine, jingoistic Israeli soldier. ‚ÄúI allowed my subjects to be sensitive, childlike and anxious,‚Äù he says. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúBefore starting work on the Soldiers series, I decided my subjects would never be in combat,‚Äù Nes has also said. ‚ÄúThey would always be in between. They eat, sleep, take a piss, but they never fight. Still, death is always present, lingering. The sleeping soldiers on the bus look as if they may be dead, because, as I was working on these pieces, suicide bombers were blowing themselves up in buses.‚Äù",2553,49

The anniversary dovetails with new findings from Honest Reporting, about how freelance photographers from the AP, CNN, and Reuters were present for the Hamas attacks, raising questions about their complicity.

From ‚ÄúThe Un-Jews,‚Äù by Natan Sharansky and Gil Troy: ‚ÄúThe anti-Zionists know exactly what they are doing, and what they are undoing. They are trying to disentangle Judaism from Jewish nationalism, the sense of Jewish peoplehood, while undoing decades of identity-building‚Ä¶these anti-Zionists join a long history of such un-Jews, who wormed their way deep into the tradition and tried to weaken Jewish identity ideologically from within by canceling a central pillar of contemporary Jewish identity, as part of what they imagine to be a wider commitment to world liberation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI now know I suffered from a failure of imagination, both moral and practical.
