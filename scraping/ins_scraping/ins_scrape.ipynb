      "Half a century ago, caimans, aquatic reptiles, were taken from their homelands in the tropical wetlands of Latin America and brought to the U.S. for the leather and pet trades. Most of the hundreds of thousands of caimans imported into the country during the 1970s perished, but a few held out in the southernmost corner of Florida. Like many invasive species there, they’ve become a nuisance. And they’re more aggressive when cornered than native crocodilians, potentially putting people at risk of attacks.\n",

      "Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri, was built during World War II and has made nearly all the rifle cartridges used by the U.S. military since it pulled out of Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, it has also pumped billions of rounds of military-grade ammunition into the commercial market, an investigation by The New York Times found, leaving the “LC” signature scattered across crime scenes, including the sites of some of the nation’s most heinous mass shootings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plant, operated by a private contractor with Army oversight, is now one of the country’s biggest manufacturers of commercial rounds for the popular AR-15, and it remains so even as the U.S. government supplies ammunition to Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A vast majority of Lake City rounds sold by retailers have been purchased by law-abiding citizens, including hunters, farmers and target shooters. Some of those people are drawn to the ammunition because it’s made with the same materials, and often to the same specifications, as the military’s. Others see the rounds as authentic accessories for their tactical weapons and gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than one million pages of search warrants, police evidence logs, ballistics reports, forfeiture records and court proceedings compiled by The Times provide a sweeping accounting of how Lake City ammunition, once intended for war, has also cut a criminal path through towns and cities in nearly all 50 states.\n",

      "The musical, “Harmony,” tells the story of the Comedian Harmonists, a singing group torn apart by the rise of Nazism and World War II. It is a decades-in-the-making labor of love for Manilow and his longtime collaborator Bruce Sussman, who first conceived of the show in the early 1990s. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Harmony” debuted in San Diego in 1997 to mixed reviews, and failed to transfer. A planned Broadway run evaporated when financial backing disintegrated. Many iterations of the musical followed, but Broadway deals fell apart. “It was so heartbreaking every time it didn’t make it,” Manilow, the singer, said in an interview. Now, the musical will at last have its moment on the Great White Way. \n",

For decades, she has recalled the fire that ravaged her neighborhood, Greenwood, and the frantic trip with her grandmother to the safety of a fairground.\n",

      "Randle’s 109th birthday is Friday. She was 6 years old when a white mob attacked Greenwood with indiscriminate violence that wrought death and destruction and erased much of the promise of economic stability for future generations. She and the only other known survivor, Viola Fletcher, 109, are united in a historic legal battle to force the City of Tulsa and others to answer for the massacre.\n",

      "When @rebeccayarros pitched her publisher a sexy fantasy about telepathic dragons and their riders, she thought it might be a tough sell. However, “Fourth Wing” — an intricately plotted 500-plus-page narrative that takes place at an elite war college as two dragon riders feud, then fall in love — became a huge best seller. And on Tuesday, after much anticipation, the novel’s follow-up, “Iron Flame,” the second installment of a planned five-book series, is scheduled to publish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The runaway success of “Fourth Wing” stems in part from Yarros’s experience with chronic illness and her life in a military family, which she drew on while crafting the novel.\n",

      "On a Saturday in October, in a small foundry, Erin Thompson watched as “a man in heat-resistant attire pulled down his gold-plated visor, turned on his plasma torch and sliced into the face of Robert E. Lee.” The statue had stood in Charlottesville, Va., since 1924 — and had been the subject of incredible controversy. A petition to remove the statue — organized by Zyahna Bryant in 2016 — led to a series of white nationalist rallies held to ensure it remained standing, which ultimately culminated in the death of counterprotester Heather D. Heyer. Now, a group called Swords Into Plowshares is repurposing the statues’ bronze to make a new piece of public art. “The way our communities dispose of these artifacts may influence America’s racial dynamic over the next century, just as erecting them did for the hundred-year period now ending,” @artcrimeprofessor writes. “99 years after the monument’s installation and 158 years after the end of the Civil War, it’s high time we start figuring this out.” Click the link in our bio to read more.| 📷 @ezeamosphotography and @audramelton #nytopinion\n",

      "⁠\n",
      "Scammers posing as teen girls befriend boys online, share nude photos of a girl and then ask for nude photos in return. Once the boy reciprocates, the schemer demands money be sent by a peer-to-peer payment app and threatens to share the boy’s photos with his social-media followers if he doesn’t pay.⁠\n",
      "⁠\n",
      "That is how law-enforcement officials and child-protection experts describe a growing wave of online predators targeting teens. Previously, online sextortion—as they call it—largely involved pedophiles blackmailing kids into sending photos or videos. These new scammers focus on money, law-enforcement officials say.⁠\n",
      "⁠\n",
      "Three years ago, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received fewer than 10 reports of this sort of financial extortion. Last year, the congressionally mandated nonprofit received more than 10,000—and has already received 12,500 this year.⁠\n",
      "⁠\n",
      "In a survey of more than 6,000 teens and young adults in the U.S. and five other countries conducted by Snapchat’s parent company, 65% of respondents said they or their friends have been targeted in schemes where unknown attackers obtained explicit personal imagery or other private information, then threatened to release the material to friends and family. The majority of those approached were boys.⁠\n",
      "⁠\n",
      "Boys are easily lured because they respond to sexual photos more readily than girls do, says Lauren Coffren, NCMEC’s executive director. As soon as boys send their own photos, she says, “The immediate response back is, ‘I’m going to ruin your life if you don’t pay me.’” More than a dozen teen boys in the U.S. have killed themselves in instances involving these scams, she adds.⁠\n",
