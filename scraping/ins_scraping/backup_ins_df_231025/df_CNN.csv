CNN,Cyy43fZJBir,2023-10-24 20:34:07,GraphImage,"Finding clean water is becoming an all-consuming ‚Äì and increasingly difficult ‚Äì challenge for many Gazans.

Hamas‚Äô brutal attacks in Israel on October 7 killed at least 1,400 people and the group took more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. In the wake of the assault, Israel launched an aerial bombardment of Gaza that Palestinian health officials say has killed more than 5,000 people. Israel also announced a ‚Äúcomplete siege‚Äù on the enclave, withholding vital supplies of water, food and fuel.

Israel has since allowed some water to flow through one of the three pipelines that run into Gaza, but experts say it covers only a tiny percentage of the enclave‚Äôs needs. Most of Gaza‚Äôs water comes from local sources ‚Äì but the fuel required to pump and clean it is fast running out.

The climate crisis is also having an impact. Sea level rise will increase the salinity of the groundwater and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat and drought further threaten water resources.

But forensic analysis of publicly available imagery and footage has begun to offer some clues as to what caused the explosion.
 
CNN has reviewed dozens of videos posted on social media, aired on live broadcasts and filmed by a freelance journalist working for CNN in Gaza, as well as satellite imagery, to piece together what happened in as much detail as possible.
 
Without the ability to access the site and gather evidence from the ground, no conclusion can be definitive. But CNN‚Äôs analysis suggests that a rocket launched from within Gaza broke up midair, and that the blast at the hospital was the result of part of the rocket landing at the hospital complex.
