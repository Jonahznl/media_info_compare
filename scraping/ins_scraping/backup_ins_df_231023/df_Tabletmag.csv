Tabletmag,CyjLyVJRirN,2023-10-18 18:11:35,GraphSidecar,"Pro-Palestinian protesters are burning and destroying the Al-Hammah Tomb and Synagogue in Tunisia.

Tunisia once boasted a Jewish community of 100,000. By 1967, Jews began fleeing a wave of anti-Jewish attacks en masse. 40,000 of them went to Israel. 

With the Tunisian revolution in 2011, anti-Jewish sentiment began sweeping the country again. Soon after the revolution, a Hamas leader visited Tunis and, upon arrival at the airport, shouted, ‚ÄúKill the Jews!‚Äù A couple of months after that incident, a crowd of Salafi Muslims gathered in front of Tunis‚Äôs Grand Synagogue shouting anti-Jewish slogans, led by a cleric who urged Muslims to ‚Äúrise up and wage a war against the Jews.‚Äù

The El-Hamma tomb site of Rabbi Yosef Ma‚Äôaravi (pictured here) was also ransacked in 2011. El-Hamma no longer has a Jewish community. However, pilgrimages to Rabbi Yosef Ma‚Äôarabi tomb occur on an annual basis during the day of the month of Teveth.

The country's last kosher restaurant closed in 2015. Today, 1000 Jews remain.
