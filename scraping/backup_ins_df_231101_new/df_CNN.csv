But as much as it may feel imperative to stay fully engaged in the tragic updates and charged conversations like those about Israel and Gaza, doing so without boundaries may lead to compassion fatigue, said Dr. Rebecca Sachs, a clinical psychologist based in New York City.

The term was created to capture the experience of people in caretaking roles or professions ‚Äî such as therapists, firefighters, police officers, emergency room health care professionals and family members caring for someone with a chronic condition, said Dr. Charles Figley, Kurzweg Distinguished Chair in Disaster Mental Health at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Those who are watching traumatic things unfold in communities they are connected to as well as those they empathize with from afar may also feel the impact of compassion fatigue, Sachs said. That can lead to exhaustion, irritability and difficulty continuing to engage with their empathy if not attended to, Sachs said.

Israel has since allowed some water to flow through one of the three pipelines that run into Gaza, but experts say it covers only a tiny percentage of the enclave‚Äôs needs. Most of Gaza‚Äôs water comes from local sources ‚Äì but the fuel required to pump and clean it is fast running out.

The climate crisis is also having an impact. Sea level rise will increase the salinity of the groundwater and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat and drought further threaten water resources.

But forensic analysis of publicly available imagery and footage has begun to offer some clues as to what caused the explosion.
 
CNN has reviewed dozens of videos posted on social media, aired on live broadcasts and filmed by a freelance journalist working for CNN in Gaza, as well as satellite imagery, to piece together what happened in as much detail as possible.
 
Without the ability to access the site and gather evidence from the ground, no conclusion can be definitive. But CNN‚Äôs analysis suggests that a rocket launched from within Gaza broke up midair, and that the blast at the hospital was the result of part of the rocket landing at the hospital complex.
