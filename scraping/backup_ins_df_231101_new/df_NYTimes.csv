With her new movie, “What Happens Later,” a wily rom-com that she co-wrote, starred in and directed, she is pushing the genre’s boundaries to examine vulnerable issues of aging and love.

Returning to the genre at this point in her career is both safe and gutsy. She knows how to play the beats – and how to deflect them, too. But Ryan, 61, may also face exponential scrutiny for her choices, her humor, her looks, her very state of being. That, too, doesn’t seem to faze her. “My interest in this movie isn’t about Hollywood’s perception of me,” she said. “I’m not interested in controlling that. I don’t think I can.”

The 1.7 million Afghans living illegally in Pakistan have come under mounting pressure, according to human rights groups and migrants. So far, more than 70,000 Afghans have left. Landlords have evicted Afghan tenants, fearing large fines if they don’t. Employers have fired undocumented Afghan workers. The police have raided neighborhoods popular among Afghans, arresting those without paperwork.

Rights groups have condemned Pakistan’s actions, worried about the possibility that some Afghans could face persecution in Afghanistan for past ties to Taliban opponents. Meanwhile, Pakistani officials have established several deportation centers nationwide. Many Afghans have faced devastating decisions about whether to try to stay in a country where they are no longer welcome or return to one where they have not lived for decades.

The statistics — which include children in shelters, hotels, relatives’ homes and other transient places — illuminate the challenges for Mayor Eric Adams’s administration in handling the rise in homeless students.

The same-sex training policies are common across the industry, truckers and legal experts say, even though a federal judge ruled in 2014 that it was unlawful for a trucking company to require that female job candidates be paired only with female trainers.

As recently as 10 years ago, a whale or dolphin sighting was an uncommon occurrence on the East End of Long Island. The overfishing of Atlantic menhaden had led to a huge drop in marine life off the coast. Since 2012, coastwide catch limits on the fish have led to populations rebounding, improving water quality and bringing more marine animals closer to the beach than they’ve been since the middle of the last century.

That resurgence, often just out of human sight, is fairly new. That is, until @suttonlynch, a photographer who has gained a devoted online following, started documenting this dramatic turning point in the East End’s environmental and cultural history with his drone.

The video shows a projectile streaking through the darkened skies over Gaza and exploding in the air. Seconds later, another explosion is seen on the ground.

The footage has become a widely cited piece of evidence as Israeli and American officials have made the case that an errant Palestinian rocket malfunctioned in the sky, fell to the ground and caused a deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

But a detailed visual analysis by The New York Times concludes that the video clip — taken from an Al Jazeera television camera livestreaming on the night of Oct. 17 — shows something else. The projectile seen in the video is most likely not what caused the explosion at the hospital. It actually detonated in the sky roughly two miles away, The Times found, and is an unrelated aspect of the fighting that unfolded over the Israeli-Gaza border that night.

The Times’s finding does not answer what did cause the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital blast, or who is responsible. The contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch is to blame remains plausible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.

The hospital blast has become a searing, contested episode in the war that began on Oct. 7, after Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, invaded Israel, killing more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers and seizing 200 hostages who were taken back to Gaza, according to the Israeli government. Israel has responded with a relentless artillery and bombing campaign that has killed 5,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry. The Israeli military is also preparing for a ground invasion.

Catholic women have been clamoring for more equal footing and greater say in the workings of the church for years but, while consensus is building for different forms of advancement, there remains deep opposition to the ordination of women as deacons, let alone priests.

NYTimes,CyvyovBLMrA,2023-10-23 15:41:57,GraphSidecar,"Gaza has been under siege for two weeks, as Israel bombards the territory with airstrikes in response to a brutal assault by Hamas. Nearly half of Gaza’s two million people have been displaced, and they are facing increasingly desperate conditions, according to the U.N. Local officials say thousands have been killed.

The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas, which controls Gaza, waged a brutal assault on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people. A ground offensive could be Israel’s next step. Its troops have been massing along the border, but it is unclear when they might enter Gaza.

One of the challenges they will face is that Hamas took more than 200 hostages from Israel, according to the Israeli military.

NYTimes,Cyvf6ZmxhV3,2023-10-23 12:58:29,GraphImage,"On Oct. 17, The New York Times published news of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City, leading its coverage with claims by Hamas government officials that an Israeli airstrike was the cause and that hundreds of people were dead or injured. The report included a large headline at the top of The Times’s website.

Israel subsequently denied being at fault and blamed an errant rocket launch by the Palestinian faction group Islamic Jihad, which has in turn denied responsibility. American and other international officials have said their evidence indicates that the rocket came from Palestinian fighter positions.

The Times’s initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage — and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels — relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.

The Times continued to update its coverage as more information became available, reporting the disputed claims of responsibility and noting that the death toll might be lower than initially reported. Within two hours, the headline and other text at the top of the website reflected the scope of the explosion and the dispute over responsibility.

Given the sensitive nature of the news during a widening conflict, and the prominent promotion it received, Times editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been more explicit about what information could be verified. Newsroom leaders continue to examine procedures around the biggest breaking news events — including for the use of the largest headlines in the digital report — to determine what additional safeguards may be warranted.",85267,13229

But in the decades that followed, bans were imposed on cruising by cities and counties that stereotyped lowriders as being associated with crime and gangs. The laws, which lowriders describe as discriminatory, have long prevented them from parading their cars without the fear of being cited or towed.

On Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a bill into law repealing those bans and lifting a state prohibition on modifying a vehicle to reduce its clearance significantly from the roadway.

NYTimes,CytkqmLuuH9,2023-10-22 19:01:23,GraphSidecar,"Across Africa and in parts of Asia, disruption to the supply chain for fertilizer is raising food prices and increasing malnutrition.

Farmers are grappling with shocks that made fertilizer scarce and unaffordable, diminishing harvests, raising food prices and spreading hunger. The war in Ukraine reduced the region’s grain exports and sent the price of staples like wheat soaring from Egypt to Indonesia. The world’s food supply is also menaced by the ravages of climate change — heat waves, drought, floods. 

The breakdown in fertilizer production challenges the orthodoxy that has dominated international trade for decades. Prominent economists have promoted globalization as insurance against upheaval. When factories in one place cannot produce goods, they can be summoned from somewhere else. Yet as farmers across Africa and parts of Asia contend with fertilizer shortages, their anguish attests to a less celebrated aspect of the interlinked economy: Shared dependence on vital products from dominant suppliers yields widespread danger when shocks emerge.

Over the last several decades, as people have fallen in love with floor-to-ceiling windows and light-strewn spaces, birds have suffered the consequences. Now residents are trying to fix the problem, joining a small but determined push to make glass more bird-friendly.

Greg Abbott of Texas began busing newly arrived migrants from Texas to large Democratic cities, whose leaders had pledged to provide sanctuary. The state has sent away more than 50,000 migrants, helping to provoke a shelter crisis in several U.S. cities like Denver and Chicago that has reshaped the debate over immigration.

The program is now an organized migrant transportation system that helps alleviate the strain of new arrivals on small border cities at a cost of roughly $75 million, and that number is growing. Still, it has not succeeded in what is perhaps Abbott’s biggest goal: forcing the federal government to adopt more stringent border controls, favored by Republicans.

Now, Abbott is trying to change Texas law to make crossing the border from Mexico without authorization a state crime, allowing the police in Texas to arrest people coming across the Rio Grande, including asylum seekers. The State Senate passed the bill this month during a special legislative session, though it has yet to be approved by the Texas House. Immigration lawyers said the legislation amounted to a violation of the federal government’s pre-emptive role in setting immigration policy.

A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the U.S. is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising the experts who track it closely. 

As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, with figures in some places rising to levels incompatible with human life, governments are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy sources to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the world.

Fossil fuels, however, still dominate energy production at home and abroad, and there are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and in mining enough minerals for clean technologies.

Many of them see it as a sign of Australia taking a step to do right by them after centuries of abuse and neglect, and help with everything from everyday issues like home repair to moving the needle on weightier aspirations, like reparations.

In reality, the measure, known as the Voice, is much more modest, making some of these expectations appear rather lofty.

At the same time, it has given rise to unrealistic fears — like that of homeowners being forced to return their land to Indigenous people — that have galvanized opposition to the Voice.

Since then, breaking has mostly faded from hip-hop’s forefront in the U.S. But now, the New York City-born dance style is preparing for its biggest international spotlight yet, when it debuts at the Olympic Games in Paris next year. 

The new platform has left both pioneers and younger breakers to grapple with issues of authenticity that some of hip-hop’s other tenets have already confronted. Some breakers are concerned that the Olympics will strip the soul from the struggle that breaking sprung from, and contend that breaking is an art form, not a sport. Others argue that hip-hop is already overly commodified, commercialized and disfigured; its authenticity distilled in fragmented pockets.

Now, spurred by frustrations that arose during the Covid pandemic and connected by digital technologies, like WhatsApp, that have reached even remote areas, community health workers are organizing to fight for fair compensation. For more than a billion people in low-income countries, community health workers deliver the main, and sometimes only, health care available.

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria recently became the first major international health organization to require countries that receive its grants to budget what delivery would be done by community health workers and the funding gap for remunerating them. Still, only 34 of the 193 member states in the U.N. have formalized the role of community health workers with training, accreditation and minimum wages. And 86% of community health workers in Africa are completely unpaid.

On a visit to a vast monastery in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, A. Altannar’s father brought him and his toddler twin brother into a room where they and seven other boys were given a secret test. A. Altannar behaved differently from the other children. He picked out a set of prayer beads and put it around his neck. He rang a bell used for meditation. He walked over to a monk in the room and playfully climbed on his legs.

The monks had found the 10th reincarnation of the Bogd, and for the next seven years, they kept his identity a secret.

But who gets to be the Bogd is a sensitive question with implications for Mongolia, China and Tibet. So when the Dalai Lama appeared with A. Altannar in public this year at a ceremony in India, it was a defiant assertion of his influence over Tibetan Buddhism and a challenge to Beijing’s claims over succession. And it put Mongolia on the spot, straining its delicate relationship with China.

Exactly what happened to Armita on Sunday is not clear, but the news of another young woman in a coma under murky circumstances — another girl, another metro station, another hospital, another grief-stricken family — was enough to stir outrage in Iran and fuel accusations that the government’s hijab agents must have harmed her.

NYTimes,CyBMghILkdI,2023-10-05 13:23:43,GraphSidecar,"After surviving more than three decades of on-and-off war and pressure from big outside powers to give up, or at least narrow, its ambitions as a separate country with its own president, army, flag and government, the Republic of Artsakh, within the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan, collapsed almost overnight.

Tens of thousands died fighting for or against it, destroying the careers of two presidents — one Armenian, one Azerbaijani — and tormenting a generation of American, Russian and European diplomats pushing stillborn peace plans. It outlasted six U.S. presidents.

But the self-declared state in the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh — recognized by no other country — vanished so quickly last week that its ethnic Armenian population, driven by fears of ethnic cleansing by a triumphant Azerbaijan, had only minutes to pack before abandoning their homes and joining an exodus.

A fingerprint found on a ransom note led investigators to the suspect, who apparently dropped off the note at Charlotte’s house himself — and, though a trooper had been stationed outside, left without being apprehended.

Charlotte's disappearance Saturday night had shattered a weekend family camping trip. She was reunited with her parents on Monday, and was said to be in good health. The suspect, Craig Nelson Ross Jr., was arrested at his mother’s home on Monday and charged with first-degree kidnapping on Tuesday. He pleaded not guilty; additional charges are expected, according to the New York State Police.

In Portland, a record-breaking number of daily emergencies has strained every part of the system: hold times for 911 calls have quintupled since 2019; the average police response time has slowed to nearly an hour; firefighters work overtime, handling more overdoses than actual fires; and each week there is a shortage of ambulances left to respond to hundreds of medical emergencies.
 
Most major U.S. cities now have at least three times the number of security guards on the street as sworn police officers, even though guards typically operate with minimal oversight, less training and little power to enforce the law.

Despite its water-damaged interior — a warren of cramped bedrooms and leaky bathrooms once occupied by priests — the artist felt strongly that the building, which dates to around 1907, should remain standing, as a part of the area’s history. But she also aspired to give it a new life as a family home and studio.

Once the contractor’s team began peeling back layers of plaster, they found that the joists were rotten and that the whole interior had to be demolished. But the artist and the architects came to see this discovery as liberating — it freed them to create an entirely new layout.

Though Mountain View’s economy depends to a large extent on tourism, the place is authentic. People there are living their lives as they always have, not because they think you will find it enchanting, but because that is what they do and they like doing it.
