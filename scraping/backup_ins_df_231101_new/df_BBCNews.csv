Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a demon lurking in the shadows in his picture The Death of Cardinal Beaufort, based on a Shakespearean death scene.
 
But ""the fiend"" eventually disappeared beneath layers of paint and varnish.
 
The 1789 artwork has now been restored and put back on display, with the demon in full view.
 
The fanged creature can be seen at the head of the bed, in the shadows, as Cardinal Beaufort lies dying, with King Henry VI and two lords at his bedside.

Researchers at University of California in Los Angeles have been investigating the different types of facial expressions cats use to communicate with each other.

Humans have around 44 unique facial movements, but their total number of expressions isn't known, so it’s hard to compare cats with us - but we do know that chimpanzees have around 357 unique expressions. 
 
The team also found that cats have some expressions in common with humans - and think they may have picked them up from their 10,000 year history of living with us.

Hollywood blockbusters are often a great source of inspiration for a Halloween costume, even for actors working in the industry.

But not so much this year.

Sag-Aftra - the union that represents actors and is behind the current strikes in Hollywood - has warned members that dressing up as characters from certain shows and movies would break the strikes' rules.

So outfits based on Barbie, Wednesday Addams and some film superheroes are banned.

“Let's use our collective power to send a loud and clear message to our struck employers that we will not promote their content without a fair contract!”, the union told its members.

The late Silvio Berlusconi has left behind nearly 25,000 paintings that must be stored in a huge warehouse - and dealing with them is proving difficult for his heirs.

The sheer number of pieces aside, managing the huge art collection has not been helped by one of Italy's leading art critics Vittorio Sgarbi mocking the hoard, saying most of the pieces are poor quality and hold no value.

He estimates ‘six or seven’ of the 25,000 paintings have any artistic value.

But art dealer Cesare Lampronti, who was friends with Berlusconi, said the politician was an “impulsive buyer” and did not purchase the art thinking it was worth anything.

""He liked to buy portraits of women he gave as gifts to friends. When he was younger, he bought at galleries and from dealers, but later in life he bought from TV auctions.”

It’s been a little over 24 hours since the Palestinian militant group launched its unprecedented attack on the country.

Through the night, Israel’s air defence system - known as the Iron Dome - could be seen striking its targets, lighting up the sky.

Israel also launched retaliatory air strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip, which have killed more than 250 people in the area, Palestinian officials say.

On Saturday morning, Hamas launched a wave of rocket attacks as gunmen stormed into Israel, in the biggest escalation in decades.

The attack has left at least 250 Israelis dead, with as many as 100 civilians and soldiers reported to have been kidnapped.

The incredible eco-restoration of one tiny Caribbean island has captured the imagination of environmentalists worldwide.

Redonda was transformed from a desolate rock to a wildlife haven in just a few years by the tenacious Antiguans and Barbudans who led the change. 

The mile-long spot has been officially designated a protected area ensuring its status as a pivotal nesting site for migrating birds and a home for species found nowhere else on Earth.

Today, Redonda is bursting with biodiversity including dozens of threatened species, globally important seabird colonies, and endemic lizards.

A baby beaver was spotted in London for the first time in a very long time this summer.

Enfield council began London's beaver reintroduction programme in 2022 to bring beavers back to the capital after 400 years.

The young beaver will go through a thorough health check with an experienced exotic-animal vet and confirm its sex, which at this stage remains undetermined.

Pied tamarin monkeys living just outside the city of Manaus have started to communicate with each other using smells and scent, instead of by calls and noises.

The city is getting bigger, spreading into the monkey's habitat - and noise from people and cars is getting a lot louder.

It's a worry for experts - the pied tamarin is already critically endangered, and the city's expansion is only making things harder for the species' survival.

​​
​​The Milky Way is a ‘disc’ galaxy and these galaxies may be the kind where life can develop.
​​
​​Experts in the UK and Canada found that galaxies that look like the Milky Way are 10 times more common than previously thought.
​​
​​“Based on our results astronomers must rethink our understanding of the formation of the first galaxies and how galaxy evolution occurred over the past 10 billion years,” said one researcher.
