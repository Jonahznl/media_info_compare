They were the first to make it out of the Gaza Strip since Hamas‚Äô surprise terror attack and the ensuing Israeli bombardment and siege on the Palestinian enclave.

One man, his leg apparently amputated, said goodbye to his loved ones, accepting their kisses on his cheeks and forehead. A young boy cried in pain, his leg wrapped in bandages and encased in metal brace, waiting to be transported for urgent medical care on the other side.

Many foreign passport holders have lingered near the border since the first days of the war, pushed south by Israeli orders and drawn there by promises that the crossing might open for them to evacuate.

But the gates never opened to civilians ‚Äî until today.

In September, Pasco authorities approved a $540 million plan to add a fourth boiler to the county‚Äôs waste-to-energy facility. These plants handle highly hazardous materials, and even the cleanest operations emit federally allowable levels of noxious chemicals formed during combustion.

Proponents of the plants point out the energy they generate helps power local communities. But residents‚Äô concerns over the potential health risks have drawn more scrutiny around the project.

Ana Vale relocated her family from Atlanta last year to a home in Doral, Florida, about 20 doors down from Miami-Dade County‚Äôs incinerator. About two weeks after moving in, her now-14-year-old daughter began complaining about her skin itching and burning. Soon afterward, a dermatologist diagnosed her with eczema.

While recent research has linked environmental toxins, including air pollution, to rising rates of eczema, Vale said her daughter‚Äôs doctor didn‚Äôt draw any conclusions about the role of the incinerator. But she believes it‚Äôs a factor.

West Virginia was among the first states to restrict some or all trans student athletes from playing on school sports teams consistent with their gender identities.

A hearing in front of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals was the most recent update in her more than two-year legal battle, which began in May 2021, when she was 11, a month after West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill that bars transgender girls from playing on girls sports teams in middle school, high school and college.

The appeals court will decide whether the law will take effect, and its decision could also start a chain of events that could land Becky‚Äôs case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Becky has been allowed to run on her school‚Äôs cross country team and throw discus and shot put on the track and field team since the appeals court reinstated a previous injunction against the law in February.
