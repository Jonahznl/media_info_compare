Sharma criticizes the low status of women in rural society. “There is no value of a woman in a village,” she said. “In a village, an animal has more value to it than a woman, as an animal gives milk and there is cost attached to it,” she said.⁠

The ""invasive species supper clubs"" aim to popularise species that are detrimental to the environment. However, scientists are sceptical of the idea. While the three species served are ""forces of destruction"", they are also edible and ""delicious"", according to chef Douglas McMaster, who hopes to create a legitimate supply chain for chefs at his Silo restaurant.⁠
.⁠
However, Professor Karim Vahed of the University of Derby warned that eating invasive species could actually worsen the problem. For example, eating signal crayfish could lead people to introduce them into other waterways. ""Consuming invasive non-native species isn't something that I would encourage,"" he says.⁠
.⁠
Invasive crayfish also transmit a fungal infection that native species are vulnerable to. While Japanese knotweed can be eaten or used to brew beer, disturbing the plant can enhance its growth, according to knotweed specialist Karen Bacon.⁠

Facing displacement, overcrowded living conditions, and a lack of access to water and menstrual hygiene products such as sanitary napkins and tampons, women have been taking norethisterone tablets – ordinarily prescribed for conditions such as severe menstrual bleeding, endometriosis, and painful periods – to avoid the discomfort and pain of menstruation.⁠

According to Dr Walid Abu Hatab, an obstetrics and gynaecology medical consultant at the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis, the tablets keep progesterone hormone levels raised to stop the uterus from shedding its lining, thus delaying a period.⁠

But there is another reality behind those postcard visuals.⁠
.⁠
The demand for Darjeeling tea in India has fallen due to the availability of cheaper alternatives from #Nepal and rising production costs, endangering the industry and the livelihoods of thousands of workers.⁠
.⁠
The Darjeeling tea industry was started by the British in the mid-19th century and now has 87 tea gardens in India's West Bengal state.⁠
.⁠
Tea experts attribute the falling production to a nearly 40% decline since gardens were converted to fully organic, severe labor shortages, and climate change.⁠
.⁠
The premium quality tea caters mostly to international markets, but exports to Russia, Japan, Iran, the US, and European countries have declined in the past five years.⁠
.⁠
Darjeeling tea producers blame Nepal's free trade agreement with India as one of the key reasons for squeezing their market share, as Nepal's orthodox tea is much lower in cost.⁠
.⁠
The Darjeeling tea industry has been demanding a revision in India's Free Trade Agreement with Nepal and strict implementation of a geographical indication (GI) tag that prohibits blending of Darjeeling with other teas.⁠

Commissioned by the Grand Admiral and built by renowned architect Mimar Sinan around 1530, the so-called “Tiled Bathhouse” was a pinnacle of architectural splendour and sophistication in the city, famous for its distinctive blue and white Iznik tiles.⁠
.⁠
The intervening centuries had not been kind to the long-forgotten marvel. As the Ottoman Empire gave way to the increasingly Westernised Turkey of the 18th and 19th centuries, sensibilities moved away from older traditions, such as hammams, causing many – including Cinili Hamam – to fall into disrepair.⁠
.⁠
Many of its fixtures – including its eponymous tiles – were stripped away to be sold to international museums and private collectors, leaving behind a hollow shell.⁠

Now, after a long and ambitious 13-year restoration effort, this lost treasure has been revitalised through the efforts of the Marmara Group and is once more a place of cleansing and relaxation, but also one that reflects much of Turkey’s hidden history.⁠

.⁠
Some rock carvings had been sighted before but now there is a greater variety that will help researchers establish their origins, archaeologist Jaime de Santana Oliveira said this week.⁠
.⁠
One area shows smooth grooves in the rock thought to be where Indigenous inhabitants once sharpened their arrows and spears long before Europeans arrived.⁠
.⁠
“The engravings are prehistoric, or precolonial. We cannot date them exactly, but based on evidence of human occupation of the area, we believe they are about 1,000 to 2,000 years old,” Oliveira said.⁠
.⁠
The rocky point is called Ponto das Lajes on the north shore of the Amazon near where the Rio Negro and Solimoes rivers join.⁠
.⁠
Oliveira said the carvings were first seen there in 2010, but this year’s drought has been more severe, with the Rio Negro dropping 15 metres (49.2 feet) since July, exposing vast expanses of rocks and sand where there had been no beaches.⁠

Prime Minister Benjamin #Netanyahu faced backlash after tweeting that he had not been informed about warnings of #Hamas's assault on Israel on October 7. ⁠

“This is a very difficult military campaign so you want a responsible prime minister and there is not a single person [in the government] that trusts Netanyahu – that’s the main issue for this cabinet,” says Yossi Mekelberg, associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House.⁠

Experts say this incident exposed a widening rift within the political and military establishment, questioning Netanyahu's leadership and his ability to prioritize national security over his own interests. ⁠

""When Joe #Biden won the presidential election in the United States three years ago, there were some hopes within the pro-Palestinian movement that there would be a positive change in US policy on Palestine.⁠

Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, had headed a fascist administration that had fully adopted the programme and vision of Israel’s far right. It was believed to be the worst American government for Palestinians … until now.⁠
.⁠
Today, Biden has fully embraced Israel’s genocidal aggression on Gaza, approving of the complete blockade that has cut off electricity, water, food, and medicine, and justifying the daily slaughter of hundreds of Palestinian civilians.""⁠
