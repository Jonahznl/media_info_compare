The New York Times and @kffhealthnews, a nonprofit news organization, interviewed families and experts for the “Dying Broke” series, a joint project on long-term care. Those taking care of their parents expressed concern as they watched bills pile up and found themselves having to make difficult decisions about placing their parents in assisted living facilities. “If Mom gets worse and I can’t care for her? That’s something I struggle with,” said Karina Ortega, whose mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in March 2020. She added: “I just can’t see it in me to leave my mom because she needs me.”

The hospital, Al-Shifa, has become synonymous with Israel’s 40-day effort to wrest control of Gaza from Hamas. Its capture could affect international sentiment about the invasion as well as the continuing negotiations to free the hostages captured by Hamas last month.

A senior Israeli military official said on Wednesday that troops were interrogating people inside the hospital and had found weapons during the raid, but declined to provide evidence or further details because the operation was ongoing. Palestinian officials, the heads of United Nations agencies and some Mideast regional leaders condemned the raid, warning that it risked the lives of Gaza’s most vulnerable.

Dozens of corpses are decomposing at the Al-Shifa Hospital because there is no way to preserve or remove them, a head nurse and a health official said.

The hospital and other medical centers in Gaza City had been struggling for weeks to maintain operations as supplies of fuel and medicine dwindled. The Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said on Monday that Israeli military vehicles had advanced to the gates of the hospital complex.

Patients at Al-Shifa have been dying because of a lack of power, according to doctors and Gazan health officials. Jihan Miqdad, a head nurse in the emergency room at Al-Shifa, said in a phone interview on Monday that patients who were on life support in the intensive care unit were dying because there was no oxygen.

“The situation here is catastrophic in every sense of the word,” she said.

Israeli security officials say that Hamas has built a vast command complex under the hospital, making it a legitimate military target. Hamas has denied the allegations, as has Al-Shifa’s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who has called them “untrue.”

Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri, was built during World War II and has made nearly all the rifle cartridges used by the U.S. military since it pulled out of Vietnam.

In recent years, it has also pumped billions of rounds of military-grade ammunition into the commercial market, an investigation by The New York Times found, leaving the “LC” signature scattered across crime scenes, including the sites of some of the nation’s most heinous mass shootings.

The plant, operated by a private contractor with Army oversight, is now one of the country’s biggest manufacturers of commercial rounds for the popular AR-15, and it remains so even as the U.S. government supplies ammunition to Ukraine.

A vast majority of Lake City rounds sold by retailers have been purchased by law-abiding citizens, including hunters, farmers and target shooters. Some of those people are drawn to the ammunition because it’s made with the same materials, and often to the same specifications, as the military’s. Others see the rounds as authentic accessories for their tactical weapons and gear.

But more than one million pages of search warrants, police evidence logs, ballistics reports, forfeiture records and court proceedings compiled by The Times provide a sweeping accounting of how Lake City ammunition, once intended for war, has also cut a criminal path through towns and cities in nearly all 50 states.

A secret U.S. offensive in 2016 and 2017 used an unusual strategy to fight the Islamic State. The plan: Put a minimal number of American troops on the ground and have them pound the enemy with relentless artillery fire. What no one foresaw was the devastating toll it would take on the troops who did the firing.

Research has started to reveal that as with hits in football, repeated blast exposure from firing heavy weapons may cause irreparable injury to the brain. It is a sprawling problem that the military is just starting to come to grips with.

Dave Philipps of The New York Times spoke to dozens of veterans experiencing mysterious, life-shattering mental and physical problems and investigated a type of brain injury that may have caused the problems.
