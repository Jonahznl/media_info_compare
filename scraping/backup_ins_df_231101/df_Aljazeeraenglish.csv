.⁠
Saab locked the door to her house and did not dare make a sound when the killing started in Sabra and Shatila, two neighbourhoods home to a Palestinian refugee camp in #Beirut.⁠
.⁠
On September 16, 1982, members of a far-right-wing Christian militia, Phalange Party, coordinated with Israeli forces to kill between 2,000 and 3,500 Muslim Lebanese and Palestinian civilians.⁠
.⁠
Saab said during the carnage she heard her neighbours screaming but no gunshots. Most victims were butchered with knives.⁠
.⁠
But residents of Sabra and Shatila say that what they lived through then does not compare with the shocking violence unfolding in #Gaza now.⁠ ⁠
.⁠
“As we watch what is happening in Gaza, we remember the massacre here. But it’s not the same. Gaza is worse,” Saab said.⁠

Aljazeeraenglish,Cy0-gZms0xi,2023-10-25 16:01:56,GraphSidecar,"In the neonatal intensive care unit of al-Shifa Hospital, a premature baby with a full head of thick black hair is known only as “Son of Maryam al-Harsh”.⁠
.⁠
The baby boy was delivered by emergency cesarean section as his mother was on her last breaths. She had been badly wounded in an Israeli air attack on her home in northern Gaza, which killed her husband and nine other relatives.⁠
.⁠
Son of Maryam al-Harsh was born on October 13 at 32 weeks, alive and with a faint heartbeat. He was immediately transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Shifa Hospital, and put on mechanical ventilation.⁠
.⁠
No relative has come forward to claim the baby boy, but Doctor Nasser Bulbul and his team check up on him regularly.⁠
⁠
Bulbul regards the baby, one of 54 other neonates in the hospital, as a symbol of “victory against this ugly Israeli aggression”.⁠
“As long as he is alive, he gives us strength and hope that we shall overcome these terrible days,” Bulbul said. ⁠
.⁠
“Even patience to endure the horrors we see on a daily basis.”⁠
The Gaza Strip’s 130 premature babies in seven neonatal ICUs are at risk of immediate danger if the fuel is not let in and the generators stop working.⁠
.⁠
“Without fuel to power the mechanical ventilation machines, all of these babies will die within five minutes,” Bulbul said bluntly.⁠
.⁠
Israel launched its latest offensive on the Gaza Strip on October 7 in revenge for an attack on Israel by the armed wing of Hamas that same day.⁠
.⁠
The air bombardment of Gaza has continued relentlessly and Israel imposed a total siege on it, cutting off water, electricity and fuel from the sole power plant.⁠
.⁠
With the Gaza Strip’s healthcare system on the brink of collapse, it is hard to know whether the besieged territory’s 130 premature babies in the enclave’s seven neonatal ICUs will survive, as the health ministry warned that they are in imminent danger if fuel does not reach hospitals soon.⁠

A spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas said the two captives were released following mediation from Qatar and Egypt.⁠
.⁠
In a statement on Monday, spokesperson Abu Obeida said on the group’s Telegram channel that the captives had been released for “humanitarian reasons and poor health grounds.”⁠
.⁠
The release of the two hostages, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, was confirmed by the ICRC.⁠

“We hope they will soon be back with their loved ones,” it said on X, formerly Twitter.⁠

Hamas seized more than 200 people, including Israelis and dual nationals, during an assault on southern Israel on October 7.⁠
.⁠
According to a report in the New York Times, the US is pressing Israel to delay a ground assault in order to allow for more time to secure the release of those held captive.⁠
.⁠
Israel has also been accused of showing disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians in its response to the attack by Hamas, cutting off access to food, water, fuel, and electricity to Gaza’s 2.3 million residents as it carries out a relentless campaign of air strikes that have levelled entire neighbourhoods and brought humanitarian conditions to a breaking point.⁠

Paddy Cosgrave, a co-founder of the European tech conference Web Summit which brings together thousands of leading tech startups and firms in Lisbon, Portugal, resigned on Saturday after receiving blowback from sponsors and attendees.

Cosgrave, an Irish entrepreneur who founded Web Summit in 2009, took to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to weigh in on Israel’s ongoing bombing campaign in Gaza, which local authorities say has so far killed more than about 4,400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and devastated much of the territory’s infrastructure.⁠

There were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons prior to October 7 when the Palestinian armed resistance group Hamas launched an attack on Israel, which responded almost immediately with a relentless bombing campaign.⁠
.⁠
The number of prisoners has now risen to more than 10,000 people, Palestinian officials said on Thursday afternoon.⁠

Over the past two weeks, according to officials and rights groups, Israel has arrested some 4,000 labourers from Gaza who were working in Israel and is holding them in military bases.⁠

Separately, it has also arrested 1,070 other Palestinians in overnight army raids in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.⁠

The first hints of Black solidarity with Palestinians started popping up in the mid-50s but it was first notably expressed when Malcolm X challenged Zionists’ “right” to take Palestine and uproot its people in a quote he gave to the Egyptian Gazette in 1964. In the 70s, the Black Panther Party would often use a picture of Leila Khaled, a fighter in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as imagery for an intercommunal fight against white supremacy. ⁣
 ⁣
Palestinians have also returned that support. In 2014, Palestinians reached out to BLM protesters in Ferguson and taught them how to deal with tear gas. Then in 2020, Palestinians painted murals of George Floyd in Palestine and chanted “I can’t breathe” while being attacked by Israeli forces. ⁣

.⁠
The signatories of the letter, which Al Jazeera has seen, say they “hardly recognise the values of the EU”, claiming there is a “seeming indifference demonstrated over the past few days by our institution towards the ongoing massacre of civilians in the Gaza Strip, in disregard for human rights and international humanitarian law”.⁠
.⁠
They say they are saddened by the Commission’s “double standards”, since it considers the blockade of Ukraine by Russia as an act of terror, while Israel’s blockade of Gaza is “completely ignored”.⁠
.⁠
“If Israel does not stop immediately, the whole Gaza Strip and its inhabitants will be erased from the planet,” the letter read.⁠
.⁠
“We urge you [von der Leyen] to call, together with the leaders of the whole Union, for a ceasefire and for the protection of civilian life. This is at the core of the EU existence,” they said, warning “the EU risks losing all credibility”.⁠
.⁠
The letter represents deep divisions within the bloc on how to approach the Israel-Gaza war, which in less than two weeks has killed thousands of people.⁠
.⁠
The European Commission’s “recent unfortunate actions or positions seem to give a free hand to the acceleration and the legitimacy of a war crime in the Gaza Strip”, the letter said.⁠
.⁠
In Gaza, more than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them children.⁠
.⁠
“We would have been proud if the European Union … had called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and indiscriminate violence against civilians,” the letter read.⁠
.⁠
The call on von der Leyen follows other signs of political friction in the West, with reports that US diplomats are preparing a “dissent cable” on the Middle East war, a document criticising Washington’s policy that goes to State Department leaders.⁠

One of Gaza’s 1,000 Christians, Jahsan never doubted the church was a safe space for him, his pregnant wife and two children aged five and six. The Greek Orthodox church – the oldest in the city, located in the Zaytoun neighbourhood – has traditionally served as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims during Israel’s periodic wars against Gaza.⁠

The church was sheltering hundreds of people when an Israeli bomb severely damaged one of the four buildings in its compound on Thursday evening, causing its ceiling to collapse and leaving dozens trapped under slabs of concrete, according to witnesses.⁠

By Friday afternoon, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem told Al Jazeera at least 18 people were confirmed to have been killed, including several children.⁠

.⁠
Josh Paul, a director in the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, wrote in a note published online on Wednesday that the administration of President Joe Biden was repeating the same mistakes Washington has been making for decades.⁠
.⁠
“The response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people,” he wrote.⁠
.⁠
“I fear we are repeating the same mistakes we have made these past decades, and I decline to be a part of it for longer,” he said, adding that the Biden administration’s “blind support for one side” was leading to policy decisions that were “shortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse”.⁠
.⁠
“I knew it was not without its moral complexity and moral compromises, and I made myself a promise that I would stay for as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do,” wrote Paul who was involved in arms transfers to US allies for more than 11 years.⁠
.⁠
“I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued – indeed, expanded and expedited – provision of lethal arms to Israel I have reached the end of that bargain,” he said.⁠
.⁠
In an interview with The New York Times, Paul also said that “continuing to give Israel what he described as carte blanche to kill a generation of enemies, only to create a new one, does not ultimately serve the United States’ interests”.⁠
.⁠
“What it leads to is this desire to sort of impose security at any cost, including in cost to the Palestinian civilian population,” he told the US publication. “And that doesn’t ultimately lead to security.”⁠

The expected delivery of aid is set to be the first after Israel said it would impose a “total blockade” on the besieged Gaza Strip that is home to 2.3 million people, cutting electricity supplies and halting flows of food and fuel, in response to a devastating attack from Hamas on Israeli territory on October 7.⁠

At least 1,400 people were killed in the attack, according to Israeli authorities.⁠

Since last Saturday, at least 55 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,100 others wounded.⁠
.⁠
According to human rights activist Samir Abu Shams, the Israeli army is in violation of multiple international laws, particularly the Geneva Conventions, which stress that civilians should be unharmed in situations of war and armed conflict.⁠
.⁠
“What we are seeing today is that the occupation forces enter civilian areas, create friction, and target civilians with gunfire without any justification,” the 60-year-old from Tulkarem said. “Most of the cases of Israeli gunfire have been against Palestinian civilians passing through the street or going to their place of work.”⁠
.⁠
On the one hand, Abu Shams went on to say, the Israeli occupation isolates the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.⁠
.⁠
“On the other, it takes revenge on civilians in the occupied West Bank and takes measures to arm settlers and gives instructions to open fire on men, women, and children,” he said.⁠

Children are particularly vulnerable, and early exposure to pollution can lead to lifelong health issues. While Indonesia has pledged to stop commissioning new coal-fired power plants from 2023 and be carbon neutral by 2050, its progress has been slow, leading to legal action.⁠

The war’s victor is just as disputed. It began with a two-pronged attack against Israel by Egypt and Syria.⁠
Egypt attacked from the south, to take back the Sinai Peninsula, and Syria from the north, to take back the Golan Heights.⁠

Israel had captured both six years prior in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, alongside occupying what remained of historic Palestine.⁠

The recently formed state was riding high on that victory: it never anticipated an attack like this, especially not during Yom Kippur, an auspicious day for Jews. Meanwhile, the politics of the Cold War played in the background.⁠

Despite having one billion fans, the sport remains largely limited to a handful of countries, with India leading the way. The sport's barriers to entry, high costs, and cultural ties to Commonwealth countries, have hindered its expansion.⁠
.⁠
“Cricket has a relatively high barrier to entry compared to most sports, simply due to the level of equipment required to play even a recreational game,” said Matt Roller, assistant editor at the ESPNCricinfo website. “In my view, that is the principal reason that football has long been a global sport: All you need is a ball and any small space.”⁠
.⁠
Unlike football's FIFA, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has only 12 full members, with dozens of other nations as associate members.⁠

Chinese Catholics are expressing concern over pressure from the government to control their religion. The Chinese Constitution does guarantee freedom of religion, however, it is not respected in practice.⁠

The government is trying to control religious customs and spaces, including those of ethnic Muslim Uighurs in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang and Tibetan Buddhists in Tibet.⁠

The encroachment on religious customs and spaces also extends beyond these ethnic minorities to Christians and the Hui, a group of Chinese-speaking adherents of Islam.⁠

The Chinese authorities have demolished crosses, broken up unapproved congregations, and arrested church leaders.⁠

President Xi Jinping has regularly called for the ""sinicisation"" of religion in China, which involves party-approved sermons and prayers, mandatory patriotic education, and the weakening of ties to religious authorities beyond China's borders.⁠
