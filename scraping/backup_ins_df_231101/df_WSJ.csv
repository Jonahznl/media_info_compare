‚Å†
The nation‚Äôs infant-mortality rate rose 3% from 2021 to 2022, reversing a decadeslong overall decline, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. The rate increased from 5.44 infant deaths for every 1,000 births to 5.6 in 2022, a statistically significant uptick.‚Å†
‚Å†
The U.S. rate is double that of many developed countries. Globally, baby death rates have fallen for decades, though five countries that have reported their rates this year recorded increases for last year.‚Å†
‚Å†
The death rate for women who give birth has also been rising in the U.S. Researchers who study the issues said the pair of trends indicate more women giving birth are facing challenges getting proper care.‚Å†
‚Å†
The health of the mother is closely linked to the risks to tiny infants. Complications during pregnancy was one of the fastest-rising causes of infant death, the CDC said, along with dangerous bacterial infections called sepsis.‚Å†

‚Å†
Together, the colleagues feasted at Ramadan and lighted candles for Hanukkah. They visited one another‚Äôs homes and attended the weddings and funerals of their co-workers‚Äô family members. Throughout past conflicts in the region, they have called their workplace an ‚Äúisland of peace.‚Äù ‚Å†
‚Å†
That harmony is now being tested.‚Å†
‚Å†
SodaStream‚Äôs presence in the region has put it in the middle of controversy over the years. A prior SodaStream factory, located in the West Bank, sparked calls for a boycott of the brand.‚Å†
‚Å†
The current factory is in the Negev Desert in southern Israel. The Gaza border is about 20 miles away. Before the Hamas terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, the SodaStream facility had about 1,500 employees, roughly a third of them Bedouin. More than 100 were Palestinians bused in every day from the West Bank. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The factory is now operating with about two-thirds of its usual staff, the company said. At least one SodaStream employee has been killed, and one has been taken hostage. Other staffers have lost close family members.‚Å†
‚Å†
SodaStream was founded more than a century ago in the U.K. and later moved to Israel. PepsiCo bought the business in 2018. SodaStream has weathered past Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, but this crisis is different from any the company has faced before.‚Å†

WSJ,CzCVU6nunBf,2023-10-30 20:31:25,GraphImage,"‚ÄúFriends‚Äù was the sitcom that defined us, and Matthew Perry‚Äôs Chandler Bing was its defining character, writes Kyle Smith, the Journal‚Äôs film critic, for @wsjopinion.

Chandler was nearly Perry‚Äôs double: a tortured loner for whom cynicism was body armor. He died prematurely on Saturday, at 54.

Flip, sarcastic and allergic to attachment, Perry typified the Gen X sensibility in his 10 years as Chandler. Our age cohort (I was born in 1966, Perry three years later) has frequently been dismissed as nondescript, but what is special about us has become apparent in retrospect. We were the last generation to grow up predigital, meaning spoken conversation was our default means of communication. We were scarred by divorce, which peaked when we were kids, like no generation before or since. Many of us sought to build replacement families out of pals living close at hand, taking dorm living as our model.

Perry‚Äôs portrayal of Chandler was informed by revealing conversations he had with the show‚Äôs writers. Unlike Matt LeBlanc‚Äôs Joey Tribbiani (a caricature of a brainless actor) and David Schwimmer‚Äôs Ross Geller (painfully earnest and therefore not typical of a generation that venerates irony), Chandler was the perpetual wry observer, wisecracking from a distance.

His cynicism and sarcasm were a reflection of our own outlook on life.

WSJ,Cy_mHgMSD42,2023-10-29 19:00:39,GraphImage,"Cannabis companies have promoted their products as helpful for anxiety, making for a potentially lucrative market. Anxious consumers have turned to weed and edibles for relief as treatments for their ailments have become harder to find. The number of available and affordable therapists badly lags demand and traditional medications don‚Äôt work for everyone.‚Å†
‚Å†
Driving both users‚Äô and businesses‚Äô hopes is a belief that pot can make us less anxious. Yet little independent scientific evidence shows that cannabis is an effective treatment for anxiety problems, and some studies have found it can worsen symptoms. Researchers say this is particularly true for products high in THC, the substance responsible for marijuana‚Äôs intoxicating effects.‚Å†
‚Å†
Cannabis use was significantly associated with increased odds of developing anxiety conditions, according to a review of research published in 2020 in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Recent cannabis use was associated with more severe symptoms in people with anxiety and mood disorders, according to another review published in 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In some surveys, cannabis users have reported that they have felt relief from anxiety symptoms after consuming cannabis. ‚Å†
‚Å†
A survey last year found that nearly two-thirds of people said they would prefer to use cannabis rather than pharmaceuticals to treat a medical issue, according to the survey conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of cannabis company Curaleaf of almost 2,000 adults who were at least 21 years old. And among the 54% of respondents who said they had ever used cannabis, 41% of them said they consumed cannabis to reduce anxiety.‚Å†

‚Å†
The number of Anchorage residents without homes grew nearly 60% between 2019 and 2023 to an estimated 1,760. That is more than bigger cities including Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.; Baltimore, and Oklahoma City, based on point-in-time counts conducted once each year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Allowing people to stay on the streets means likely injury or death in a city that experiences an average of 20 days annually below zero degrees Fahrenheit. But an arena used to house those without homes the past three winters was recently closed, and political infighting killed plans to build a large new shelter. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Now, as part of a plan approved just a month before bitterly cold temperatures typically arrive in mid-November, aid workers are scrambling to get an estimated 700 people living outdoors into a network of hotel rooms and other makeshift facilities. Some are being offered one-way tickets to the Lower 48 states.‚Å†
‚Å†
Cold weather is a growing public-health threat as more people live on the streets nationwide. Nationally, about 700 homeless people a year die from exposure to the cold, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit group. In Anchorage, a record 43 people have died from cold and other causes outdoors so far this year, compared with six in all of 2019.‚Å†

‚Å†
But it also matters where they begin on the political spectrum, and there are indications that millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z started out more liberal than prior generations. That has made them a crucial base of support for Democrats, even as some other groups of voters have moved away from the party.‚Å†
‚Å†
Gaining assets and income pushes voters toward conservative fiscal policies, such as lower taxes, that allow them to keep more of their money, researchers say. As Americans move from midlife to retirement, they are more likely to favor stability over change, and less likely to back liberal policies that upset the social order.‚Å†
‚Å†
This rightward shift is likely to affect who wins elections in 2024 and the years beyond.

WSJ,CyzJlrEt8bM,2023-10-24 23:00:25,GraphImage,"More than a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, one thing seems clear: New state bans have done little so far to deter women from obtaining abortions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Data released Tuesday shows the number of abortions ticked up slightly in the year following the high court‚Äôs Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization decision. That ruling, from June 2022, ended federal protections for the procedure, and paved the way for some 16 states to ban many or most abortions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The data indicate that abortion providers, funders and others have adapted quickly to a legal landscape that has changed profoundly. Access has been cut off throughout much of the South, and demand has surged in states in which abortion is still legal. Many providers there have had to significantly increase capacity. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In the new study, WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, found that nationwide there were 183 more monthly abortions on average in the 12-month period following the Dobbs decision compared with the monthly average prior to the decision. ‚Å†
‚Å†
While it has become much harder since the end of Roe to obtain an abortion in states with newly enacted bans, it actually appears to have become easier in many other states, thanks to increased attention and resources. Abortion funds, nonprofits that help finance abortions and logistics associated with them, have raised millions to help lower-income women pay for procedures and travel, while new clinics have opened in states such as Illinois and New Mexico that have become major destinations for women traveling from other states. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Nearly 115,000 fewer abortions were performed in the year after the Dobbs decision in states that banned abortions throughout pregnancy or after six weeks, according to the WeCount data. At the same time, states including Illinois, Florida and North Carolina‚Äîwhere the procedure remained largely legal‚Äîsaw an increase of 117,000 abortions. ‚Å†

‚Å†
Ghanaian refugee John Ekow boarded a vessel in July in the Ivory Coast with the prospect of making landfall in the U.S. There was just one problem: the ship was bound for Brazil.‚Å†
‚Å†
Brazilian officials have been bedeviled by a new phenomenon: a small but growing number of African migrants who completed a perilous 2,000-mile journey from West Africa after sneaking onto cargo ships they believed were actually headed for Europe or the U.S.‚Å†
‚Å†
Some African arrivals say criminal gangs and fishermen in West Africa tricked them into boarding the wrong ships, charging a small fee to hoist them aboard, including onto narrow platforms behind the ship‚Äôs rudder, according to researchers and authorities studying clandestine immigration. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI was gutted,‚Äù Ekow said, describing the moment the ship‚Äôs captain told him he was not in the U.S. but in Macap√°, Brazil, where the Atlantic meets the Amazon River.‚Å†
‚Å†
The 24-year-old and a friend boarded the ship in Abidjan with the help of a local fisherman. During the trip the men huddled together for warmth, rationing out tins of sardines and a bottled mush of cassava flour and water. By the third day, the food was gone. By the fifth, they ran out of water.‚Å†
‚Å†
On the seventh day, the ship suddenly slowed down. Police officers at the port of Macap√° said they could either go back to Africa or stay in Brazil and file for asylum, Ekow said. Both opted for the latter. His friend, who had brought a fistful of dollars with him, told Ekow he was going to try and trudge to the U.S.‚Å†
‚Å†
A total of 234 migrants arrived in Brazil as stowaways between 2006 and 2017, almost exclusively from Africa, hidden in ships that docked in at least 15 different states along Brazil‚Äôs almost 5,000-mile coastline, according to the latest available data from the country‚Äôs navy. ‚Å†

WSJ,Cywky2avUa7,2023-10-23 23:00:23,GraphImage,"With the Capitol in chaos and the speaker‚Äôs position going on its third week of vacancy, Rep. Matt Gaetz surveyed the consequences of his actions and declared he had no regrets.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI have extreme confidence,‚Äù the Florida Republican said in an interview from his Capitol Hill office, ‚Äúthat we will have an upgrade at the position.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The House has had no speaker since Gaetz made a motion to vacate the position, then joined on Oct. 3 with seven other Republicans and 208 Democrats to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) from the role. Rep. Jim Jordan, the archconservative Ohio Republican whom Gaetz calls a mentor, this week failed on three ballots to secure the majority of the body‚Äôs votes, losing support on each roll call and then bowing out of the race Friday afternoon. No one else seems to have a clear path to 217 GOP votes for the position. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Many of his colleagues blame Gaetz for the paralysis and acrimony that have ensued. When Gaetz rose to speak in a closed-door party meeting on Thursday, McCarthy told him to ‚Äúsit your ass down,‚Äù and another Republican, Rep. Mike Bost of Illinois, cursed and lunged at Gaetz.‚Å†
‚Å†
Asked about the encounter afterward, McCarthy told reporters, ‚ÄúListen, the whole country, I think, would scream at Matt Gaetz right now.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The upheavals that have racked the House GOP since January are less a reflection of any coherent faction than one man‚Äôs singular will. It was Gaetz who took it upon himself to block McCarthy from the speakership in January, joining with 19 others to deny him a majority until he agreed to crippling concessions. One of those was the ability for a single member to bring the motion to vacate, which Gaetz then deployed to remove McCarthy this month.‚Å†
‚Å†
While critics accuse Gaetz of attention-mongering, he insists he is about outcomes, not headlines. He says he has received a flood of approving feedback from conservatives across the country.‚Å†

‚Å†
The poll found Americans drawing a sharp distinction between Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and is committed to the destruction of Israel, and the Palestinian people who live in Gaza and the West Bank. But it also found increased support for Israel, compared with prior surveys, in its decadeslong conflicts with Palestinians.‚Å†
‚Å†

The share with favorable views of both the Israeli people and their government is higher in the new survey than in similar polls in recent years, though young people are much less supportive of the longtime U.S. ally than are older Americans.‚Å†

‚Å†
Research is making clearer the role that genes play in living to very old age. Habits like getting enough sleep, exercising and eating a healthy diet can help you stave off disease and live longer, yet when it comes to living beyond 90, genetics start to play a trump card, say researchers who study aging.‚Å†
‚Å†
About 25% of your ability to live to 90 is determined by genetics, says Dr. Thomas Perls, a professor of medicine at Boston University who leads the New England Centenarian Study. By age 100, it‚Äôs roughly 50% genetic, he estimates, and by around 106, it‚Äôs 75%.‚Å†
‚Å†
Centenarians make up a growing share of the U.S. population. There are about 109,000 centenarians living in the country in 2023, according to Census Bureau projections, up from about 65,000 10 years ago, thanks in part to decades of advances in medicine and public health.‚Å†
‚Å†
Knowing what enables some people to live very long lives has consequences for the rest of us. Ongoing research into very old age may help provide insight that could eventually be used to develop drugs or identify lifestyle changes to help people live healthier for longer, says Dr. James Kirkland, president of the American Federation for Aging Research.‚Å†

In August, the Journal reported that more than 50 websites were selling knockoff semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in Ozempic and Mounjaro respectively.

‚Å†
The documents from Remington Arms‚Äîwhich was part of a firearms conglomerate called Freedom Group‚Äîare being disclosed by a lawyer who obtained them in a lawsuit filed by parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Last year they settled with Remington, which made the AR-15 used by the killer, for $73 million. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Digital replicas of real guns have appeared in numerous videogames, and executives from both industries have acknowledged they signed partnerships for that purpose. But they haven‚Äôt disclosed the details of such deals or discussed the motivations behind them.‚Å†
‚Å†
The documents, from the late 2000s and early 2010s, show Remington and Freedom Group officials pursued deals to place their guns in shooter videogames as part of a marketing push for new audiences because they were concerned their customer base was aging.‚Å†
‚Å†
Executives at the gun giant, which was owned by private-equity company Cerberus and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, believed such deals would ‚Äúhelp create brand preference among the next generation,‚Äù and allow the company to ‚Äúwin our fair-share of these young consumers,‚Äù according to an undated Freedom Group memo titled ‚ÄúGaming Strategy.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
The records show Remington signed a deal in 2009 with videogame publisher Activision Blizzard to put a new weapon called the Adaptive Combat Rifle, or ACR, in its 2009 release ‚ÄúCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.‚Äù Remington hoped to sell civilian and military versions of the ACR, a modular rifle that uses design elements from several other weapons including the AR-15. ‚Å†

Gradually you discover millions of people across the U.S. are in the same situation‚Äìone that will bring months or years of rebuilding. A gigantic solar storm has hit Earth. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The odds are low that in any given year a storm big enough to cause effects this widespread will happen. And the severity of those impacts will depend on many factors, including the state of our planet‚Äôs magnetic field on that day. But it‚Äôs a near certainty that some form of this catastrophe will happen someday, says Ian Cohen, a chief scientist who studies heliophysics at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.‚Å†
‚Å†
To get ahead of this threat, a loose federation of U.S. and international government agencies, and hundreds of scientists affiliated with those bodies, have begun working on how to make predictions about what our Sun might do. And a small but growing cadre of scientists argue that artificial intelligence will be an essential component of efforts to give us advance notice of such a storm.‚Å†
‚Å†
The most dangerous of these solar storms is known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME, when a gargantuan blob of charged particles is catapulted from the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere by rapidly shifting magnetic fields, at speeds in excess of 8,000 times that of sound. These happen often, but we‚Äôre rarely aware of them because they only affect us when they happen to strike earth.‚Å†
‚Å†
Satellites that orbit high above Earth in so-called geostationary orbit would be the first to feel the effects. In theory, they can be incapacitated by ‚Äúkiller electrons‚Äù more common during certain kinds of solar storms. The electrons can penetrate satellites, and the resulting charge can build up, damaging electronics. Losing these satellites could cause worldwide disruption of GPS services.‚Å†

WSJ,CyY3VaBMo9U,2023-10-14 18:00:31,GraphSidecar,"After a historic run-up in prices, the luxury rental market in the Miami area is seeing a significant slowdown. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Although rents are still generally higher than they were prepandemic, local real-estate agents said the velocity of people moving to Miami has slowed and there are fewer people willing to overpay. Meanwhile, newly built apartments are adding thousands of rental units to the market, further easing the supply-demand imbalance that has characterized the market over the past few years.‚Å†
‚Å†
In the Miami luxury market, defined as the top 10% of the market, nearly all segments are down from pandemic-era peaks, said local real-estate agent Ana Bozovic, whose firm Analytics.Miami tracks the market. ‚Å†
‚Å†
So far this year, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom house in Miami-Dade County is $8,500, down 15% from $10,000 last year, she said. For condos, the median monthly rent for a luxury three-bedroom is $8,200, down 8.9% from $9,000 last year.‚Å†
‚Å†
Overall, Miami‚Äôs rental market seems to be cooling faster than other cities nationwide, according to data from listing website Zumper. In September, the median monthly rent for a Miami one-bedroom apartment fell 1.47% to $2,690 from the month before, and 1.96% to $2,500 in Miami Beach, Zumper said. By comparison, the median rent for a one-bedroom nationwide grew 0.1% to $1,511 during the same period.‚Å†
‚Å†
The dip is a sharp change from the frenzied pace of the real-estate market over the past few years, as an influx of people moved to Miami for warm weather and low taxes, driving up real-estate values to historic levels. ‚Å†

Hamas fighters on the ground explicitly targeted Israeli civilians for killing. Israelis were shot while driving along the street. They were pulled from their homes and killed. Hamas carried out the mass murder of some 260 people at the Tribe of Nova music festival.

Vladimir Putin, a purported friend of Israel, has said little, other than blaming a failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East. No surprise there. What Hamas did to the Israelis is what Putin has been doing to civilians in Ukraine for almost two years.

Since the February 2022 invasion, it is estimated that about 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. Russia has killed hundreds with missiles fired into residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns. It has targeted schools, hospitals and food markets.

These civilian deaths‚Äîby Hamas in Israel and Russia in Ukraine‚Äîare not collateral damage from urban warfare. They are part of the war plan, thought out by calm men sitting around a table, in Moscow or Beirut, looking at maps and civilian targets. Crimes against humanity are becoming normalized.

Our adversaries‚ÄîRussia, Iran, China and North Korea‚Äîwill continue the mass killing of civilians and hostage-taking as a strategic policy until the U.S. decisively counters this awful new normal.

Houston, Dallas and Austin top the list of major U.S. cities with the highest office-vacancy rates, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics.

Texas office floors are struggling to find tenants even though the state‚Äôs workers have been more eager to get back to the office than in most other places. According to Kastle Systems, which measures occupancy by counting keycard swipes in 10 major metro areas, Houston, Austin and Dallas have the highest office-return rates.‚Å†
‚Å†
Vacancies are high largely because Texas developers build too much. All three cities experienced a surge in construction in the 1980s, when tax rules favored developers and loose lending created a commercial real-estate bubble. Another construction spurt in the late 1990s aggravated the problem.‚Å†
‚Å†
Texas‚Äô high vacancy rate offers more evidence that the U.S. office market‚Äôs biggest problem hasn‚Äôt been primarily remote work.

‚Å†
The 15-minute meeting is the fastest-growing block of time that workers and bosses are scheduling, according to an analysis of Microsoft Teams data, which also shows people are booking fewer hourlong meetings. Fifteen-minute meetings now make up 60% of calendared gatherings, proving that executives and employees alike have grown more ruthless with their time. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Over three-fourths of employees say shorter meetings are more efficient, according to a new poll of more than 2,000 U.S. workers conducted last month by market-research firm CivicScience. One-third of respondents said they stop paying attention after 15 minutes anyway.‚Å†
‚Å†
Running an effective 15-minute meeting is more art than science, leadership and organizational efficiency experts say. If you‚Äôre all business, you appear too brusque. Try to finesse the room too much, though, and you risk coming off soft. To adhere to a tight schedule, keep in mind four rules (that are also good hygiene for longer meetings). ‚Å†

The younger Arnault is learning the ropes of his father‚Äôs luxury‚Äôs empire, and Louis Vuitton has bet on the 24-year-old to turn the brand into a player in high-end, mechanical watchmaking.‚Å†
‚Å†
Jean was standing in a gilded, mirrored room of Paris‚Äôs Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay showing off Louis Vuitton‚Äôs newest watch model to a clutch of experts one July morning. The thin unisex watch, named the Tambour, was the result of almost two years of work. But the most valuable Tambour in the building wasn‚Äôt on display with the others. It was on Arnault‚Äôs wrist.‚Å†
‚Å†
His version was made of the rare metal tantalum. Tantalum gave the watch its gunmetal color, though the metal‚Äôs hardness also meant that the watch took twice as much time to manufacture. This made it ‚Äúinsanely expensive‚Äù when he bought it, Arnault said, though he refused to reveal what he paid.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only going to make one,‚Äù Arnault said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs the only one.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
Two years ago, when he first joined Louis Vuitton‚Äôs watches division as market ing and development director, Louis Vuitton watches ran a wide gamut. They ranged from watches costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to quartz timepieces that sold for around $4,000.‚Å†
‚Å†
Now Arnault has decided to eliminate the entry-level Tambours. His thinking was that instead of producing more affordable collections, Louis Vuitton needed to play in a different class. So the new iteration of the timepiece ranges in price from $18,500 to $52,000, putting it in competition with similar creations from the likes of Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to make a ton of money with this,‚Äù Arnault says of the company‚Äôs strategic about-face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be highly profitable at all, but it‚Äôs really about making sure that we switch the message completely.‚Äù‚Å†

WSJ,CyD8ZDRsrTi,2023-10-06 15:01:05,GraphImage,"Americans who eat their way through European vacations sometimes come home surprised to see a lower number on the scale. The phenomenon has become something of an internet debate, with some people speculating that weight loss on European sojourns points to unhealthy American diets and processed foods.‚Å†
‚Å†
So what‚Äôs the real answer? Alas, there‚Äôs no definitive explanation. You might be surprised (or not!) to find out that research on vacation is scant.‚Å†
‚Å†
Scientists who study nutrition and health say that people who lose weight on international travels are likely benefiting from two things: more daily steps while on vacation and, yes, food that is often healthier and less processed.‚Å†
‚Å†
Ultra-processed foods common in the U.S. include artificial additives and highly refined ingredients and are rich in starch, sugar and salt, says Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of nutrition and medicine at Tufts University. He points to a study in the European Journal of Nutrition that found that among adults in the U.S., 57% of calories come from ultra-processed food, compared with 12% in Europe.‚Å†
‚Å†
What‚Äôs more, portion sizes tend to be larger in the U.S., and people drink more sodas and sugar-sweetened beverages, food researchers say. And Europeans often eat in a more leisurely way that is less prone to overeating, they note.‚Å†

‚Å†
Until recently, the school and its faculty largely disdained one of those scientists.‚Å†
‚Å†
Penn demoted Katalin Karik√≥, shunting her to a lab on the outskirts of campus while cutting her pay. Karik√≥‚Äôs colleagues denigrated her mRNA research and some wouldn‚Äôt work with her, according to her and people at the school. Eventually, Karik√≥ persuaded another Penn researcher, Drew Weissman, to work with her on modifying mRNA for vaccines and drugs, though most others at the school remained skeptical, pushing other approaches. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Karik√≥ hasn‚Äôt only proven her detractors wrong but also reached the pinnacle of science. Her research with Weissman helped lead to the mRNA vaccines that protected people worldwide during the Covid-19 pandemic and now shows promise for flu, cancer and other diseases.‚Å†
‚Å†
Penn, which patented their mRNA technology, has made millions of dollars from drugmakers that licensed it. And on Monday, when Karik√≥ and Weissman were awarded the Nobel, the school expressed a different perspective on their work.‚Å†

The reversal offers a glimpse of the clubby, hothouse world of academia and science, where winning financial funding is a constant burden, securing publication is a frustrating challenge and those with unconventional or ambitious approaches can struggle to gain support and acceptance.‚Å†

‚Å†
Bobbi de Winter had found her retirement paradise on Ecuador‚Äôs coast, where tiny red crabs scuttle across pristine beaches, giant sea turtles lay their eggs and whales breach the warm Pacific waters.‚Å†
‚Å†
De Winter, a native of Atlanta, and her husband, Andre, had recently finished building a house overlooking the Pacific, accessible by crossing a lush forest. They set up hammocks, planted banana and papaya trees, and hosted dinner parties as the sun set over the ocean. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Then came the drug gangs and horrific violence. Killings marred the once-sleepy district where they live, De Winter said, recalling how her husband once had to swerve his car to avoid a man who‚Äôd been shot in the street. A month after the De Winters finished their house, police found millions of dollars in cocaine stashed at a nearby beach, drugs that officers said were to be trafficked north on high-powered boats. A presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, was gunned down in August. ‚Å†

‚Å†
Driving the carnage is the country‚Äôs transformation into a transshipment hub for drugs from neighboring Colombia, where cocaine production hit a record high. The disarmament of Colombian drug-trafficking guerrillas in 2016 led to a power vacuum as other gangs battled to take over the routes into Ecuador, with its hundreds of miles of unguarded coast. ‚Å†

By Dec. 7, the animals will return to Chinese conservationists, who have essentially been renting the adult pandas to the National Zoo, generally for about $1 million a year since 2000. Under the agreement‚Äîpart of China‚Äôs global, soft-power ‚Äúpanda diplomacy‚Äù‚Äîcubs born in Washington go back to China, too.‚Å†
‚Å†
Zoo officials hope the pandas‚Äô absence is short-lived and are applying for a fresh batch. They are still figuring out what to do without the zoo‚Äôs stars.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúWe have folks who come repeatedly for the giant pandas, so we‚Äôre going to see a drop in attendance for that,‚Äù said Pamela Baker-Masson, the zoo‚Äôs director of communications. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to project. Are we going to stop selling panda plush in the stores? Probably not.‚Äù‚Å†

WSJ,Cx3EYzvsRCg,2023-10-01 15:00:38,GraphImage,"Amy Schneider knew she was destined to be a trivia champion in the eighth grade, when her classmates voted her ‚Äúmost likely to appear on ‚ÄòJeopardy!‚Äô‚Äù Almost 30 years later, in 2021, there she was, winning game after game on the popular quiz show. Fans flocked to her @Jeopardamy social-media accounts, made and purchased Amy Schneider Fan Club merchandise, and started stopping her in the grocery store. With her string of pearls and winsome smile, the lifelong outsider became a national icon. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Still, all throughout her run, she couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that audiences had fallen in love with someone else, or only part of her. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In her first essay collection, titled ‚ÄúIn the Form of a Question‚Äù and out Tuesday, Schneider describes a great irony: the skill she deployed to win a small fortune on television‚Äîasking the right questions‚Äîhad failed in her personal life. Her book is concerned with the biggest question of all: Who am I? In essays on cross-dressing pre-transition, polyamory and living with attention-deficit disorder, Schneider introduces readers to the real, messy, complex Amy. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Growing up in the German and Irish Catholic community in Dayton, Ohio, Schneider said she was taught not to question social norms, so it wasn‚Äôt until her 30s that she considered that she might be transgender.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI always had opinions about earrings, hairstyles, clothing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt just was a long time before I could think about those opinions as applying to me.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
For ""Jeopardy!"" viewers who didn‚Äôt encounter trans people in their daily lives, Schneider said, she had become ‚Äúan emblem rather than a person.‚Äù Yes, she had reached those who had misconceptions about the trans community, ‚Äúbut in the back of my mind was this feeling of, ‚Äòam I going to be used as a cudgel for other trans people that don‚Äôt live up to the same wholesome image?‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike, ‚ÄòAmy is fine, why can‚Äôt you be more like Amy?‚Äô‚Äù‚Å†
