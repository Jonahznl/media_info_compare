Hawley was questioning Mayorkas about a DHS employee who reportedly made inflammatory social media posts denouncing Israel after Hamas militants launched a brutal attack there on Oct. 7.

Among a volley of questions, Hawley asked, “Is this typical of people who work at DHS?” and called Mayorkas “despicable” for not answering his queries.

HuffPost,Cy6XdYJMYSy,2023-10-27 18:16:10,GraphSidecar,"Concert ticket prices were already out of control — but Bad Bunny just took it to an entirely new level of ridiculousness.⁠
⁠
Not long after the artist’s “Most Wanted” 2024 tour presale started on Wednesday, fans were criticizing the high ticket prices on social media. Prices for seats in the nosebleeds were $150-$250 on Ticketmaster, depending on the city and before fees, according to people who shared their experience on TikTok. In Miami, a 100-level ticket was $750. Prices for floor seats were even higher, with some reporting $1,000 per ticket.⁠
⁠
The fiasco follows a trend of rising ticket prices since the pandemic, with more demand after quarantine along with inflation. Taylor Swift’s concert ticket prices weren’t awful until ticket scalpers started inflating the resale prices. Both Beyoncé’s and Drake’s ticket prices were advertised for one price and then skyrocketed due to Ticketmaster’s “dynamic pricing,” which inflates prices based on demand.⁠
⁠
This can’t become the new normal. We desperately need a concert revolution and to stand up against corporate greed. ⁠
⁠
Fans need to band together and stop buying tickets when they’re overpriced like this. And many Bad Bunny fans did.⁠

Biden’s warning about overreaching in response to a traumatic event may be his most explicit call for Israeli restraint in its war on Gaza. It comes, however, as his administration has squashed public communications that mention “de-escalation,” “ceasefire,” “end to violence/bloodshed” and “restoring calm,” according to a HuffPost report. The president has also struck an unflinching pro-Israel stance, moving a carrier strike group off the coast of Israel and promising billions in military aid.⁠

Landlord Joseph Czuba, 71, was charged on Sunday with murder and hate crime for allegedly stabbing Wadea and his mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, who were his tenants in Plainfield, Illinois.⁠
⁠
Czuba was charged with two counts of hate crime alongside first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.⁠

“Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the Plainfield Township homicide department said in a statement.⁠

Jessica Smith ― whose face regularly appeared wreathed in sunshine on the beloved children’s series, which ran from 1997 to 2001 ― confirmed her pregnancy Wednesday with a pair of ultrasound photos on Instagram.⁠
⁠
“When two becomes three,” the British actor wrote in the caption, while tagging her partner, Ricky Latham. The couple are expected to welcome their daughter in January.⁠

⁠
In messages circulated on Friday, State Department staff wrote that high-level officials do not want press materials to include three specific phrases: “de-escalation/ceasefire,” “end to violence/bloodshed” and “restoring calm.”⁠
⁠
The revelation provides a stunning signal about the Biden administration’s reluctance to push for Israeli restraint as the close U.S. partner expands the offensive it launched after Hamas ― which rules Gaza ― attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7.⁠
⁠
The emails were sent hours after Israel told more than 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza that they should leave their homes and shelters ahead of an expected ground invasion of the region. On Thursday, the United Nations said Israel had given Gazans a 24-hour deadline to move to the south of the strip, adding it would be “impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences.”⁠
⁠
Asked about Israel’s evacuation order on Friday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby declined to reject or endorse it, calling it “a tall order.”⁠

“Bodies lay everywhere. The injured scream for help. You can never forget the sounds,” he reported.⁠

“Malik has managed to survive, but his family have not,” Elbursh said over footage of his tearful colleague.⁠

Israel declared war on Hamas in response. It has since laid siege to Gaza, which has a dense population of more than 2 million, bombarding the Palestinian enclave with airstrikes and preparing for a possible ground invasion. It has also shut off access to electricity, food, fuel and water in Gaza.⁠

Heiman has since learned Ditza was kidnapped by the Palestinian militant group Hamas and taken into the Gaza Strip ― and she is determined to give the world three messages.⁠
⁠
Governments worldwide should push to make sure the Hamas hostages get their medication, Heiman told HuffPost on Thursday, noting that most residents of her mother’s community were elderly people she has known “from the day I was born.”⁠

Heiman also wants global help for those detainees to be returned to their families.⁠
⁠
And she believes the U.S. must apply pressure to solve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute for good.⁠
⁠
“I hope the international community will help,” Heiman said. “This would be in the interests of everyone.”⁠
⁠
Heiman is worried her mother could be affected by Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza, a narrow, tightly packed sliver of land. Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly hit residential neighborhoods there, killing more than 1,500 people, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be preparing a ground invasion. The Israeli military on Friday ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza, which is home to over 1 million Palestinians, in what the U.N. described as an “impossible” task to carry out without “devastating humanitarian consequences.”⁠
⁠
“They are bombing Gaza, and we don’t know where she is and where all the people are,” Heiman said, referring to the scores of other hostages. “They may not be in one place.”⁠
⁠
Heiman published an essay in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Thursday describing how her anger has multiple targets: her mother’s kidnappers but also Israeli politicians whom she blames for not doing enough to support hostages’ families and for failing to establish peace with the Palestinians.⁠

“She has a really great sense of humor, so we joked up until that point,” Yonatan Zeigen, who is based in Tel Aviv, told CBC News’ Adrienne Arsenault. “We were joking and then we said, ‘OK, it’s time to stop joking,’ and just expressed love for each other, and that was it.”⁠

The attacks by Hamas, the armed group that rules over the millions of Palestinians in Gaza, have resulted in over 900 people killed in Israel, according to the nation’s military. Palestinian officials say that more than 700 people have been killed in sealed-off Gaza and the occupied West Bank since Israel launched massive retaliatory attacks with the support of Western nations.⁠

Zeigen told CBC that he does not believe his mother is missing, but instead either dead in her house or among the hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas. Authorities were still reportedly clearing the kibbutz of explosives and have not been able to provide an update on Silver’s whereabouts.⁠

Other big marital breakups lately? Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara, Britney Spears and Sam Asghari ― even in-office Canadian head of state Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire.⁠
⁠
Divorce attorneys are taking note. Lynda Hinkle, a family law attorney practicing in New Jersey, was most surprised by the news that Jeremy Allen White, the rising star of FX’s “The Bear,” and actor Addison Timlin were splitting.⁠
⁠
“I’m sure the pressure of having your career exploding and a rigorous filming schedule makes any preexisting challenges much harder, but how sad that one part of his life was blossoming while another part was dying on the vine,” she told HuffPost.⁠
⁠
Then again, she’s not that surprised; celebrities are generally pretty frequent divorcers because they can afford to, Hinkle said.⁠
⁠
But there’s more at play here, too. The uptick in celebrity summer divorces ― or early fall, as it is ― actually does reflect a real seasonal trend in matrimonial affairs. ⁠

HuffPost,CyCCyfeM2vB,2023-10-05 21:18:09,GraphImage,"""As a child, my first brush with a ghost wasn’t Casper or some other spook from a children’s book. I encountered the real deal in the house we rented in Pennsylvania after my family emigrated from Kuwait,"" writes HuffPost guest writer Salina Jivani.⁠
⁠
""It was over a century old, essentially the size and strength of a wet shoebox, and was shadowed by an ominous oak tree in a rundown neighborhood.""⁠
⁠
""My dad, who grew up poor and lost his father as a teenager, had cultivated a knack for stretching every penny he earned. Years before we moved to the U.S., he squirreled away what he could, which helped him get settled in Pennsylvania when a locally headquartered company offered him a job on an H-1 Visa.""⁠
⁠
""The timing couldn’t have been more off ― he left for America when I was 3 and my mother was pregnant with my brother ― but my parents felt their sacrifices would be well worth the potential opportunities neither of them had been fortunate enough to grow up with. Several months after my dad settled in the U.S., my mom, my brother, who was just six months old, and I joined him.""⁠
⁠
""At first, my parents chalked up the peering eyes and hushed whispers to neighborhood curiosity. We were new and my mother didn’t know a lick of English. But we soon learned there was something else going on.""⁠
⁠
""Even though I was very young at the time, I will never forget the first encounter we had.""⁠

""Avoiding eye contact with me, he muttered, 'I need to pick up my pills, wait for me in the toy aisle.'”⁠
⁠
""The doors closed behind us with a swoosh, and I watched him, unable to tear my eyes away. Before reaching the pharmacy window, he grabbed two small boxes off the shelf and discreetly slipped them into the pocket of his shiny Chicago Cubs jacket. My dad, a proud recovering alcoholic and devoted Alcoholics Anonymous member, had replaced his addiction to heroin, cocaine and booze with an unlikely substitute.""⁠
⁠
""This scene played out far too often during my prepubescent years. As he pocketed items, I’d surreptitiously scan our surroundings, mortified, hoping nobody else had noticed. I’d keep my eyes locked on the store employees, watching for any sign of suspicion. I loved my dad’s free spirit, generosity and zest for life, but I wanted to be nothing like him in these moments.""⁠
⁠
""But years later...I had inherited my father’s addiction."" ⁠

HuffPost,Cx5oOzNS13R,2023-10-02 14:52:15,GraphImage,"HBO’s John Oliver tried to cover a lot of ground on Sunday, his first night back on the air since the writers strike put his show on hiatus in May.⁠
⁠
But there was one story he had to keep going back to: Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) getting kicked out of a performance of the “Beetlejuice” musical for vaping, being disruptive, taking pictures and apparently getting very handsy with her date during the show.⁠
⁠
“I don’t want to get bogged down in it,” the “Last Week Tonight” host insisted. “After all, she was kicked out of the show, that is probably punishment enough.”⁠
⁠
He moved onto a new topic, and began speaking about economic problems in Italy.⁠
⁠
But he couldn’t stay focused as he kept interrupting his report on Italy to mention Boebert and the “fondling and light over-the-pants hands stuff which was caught on video.”⁠
⁠
Oliver was also baffled by the fact that it was “Beetlejuice” and not “one of the more explicitly sexual ones like ‘Spring Awakening’ or ‘Rocky Horror’ or ‘Cats.’”⁠
