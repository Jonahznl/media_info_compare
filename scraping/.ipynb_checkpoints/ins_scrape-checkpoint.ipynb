      "\n",
      "Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri, was built during World War II and has made nearly all the rifle cartridges used by the U.S. military since it pulled out of Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, it has also pumped billions of rounds of military-grade ammunition into the commercial market, an investigation by The New York Times found, leaving the “LC” signature scattered across crime scenes, including the sites of some of the nation’s most heinous mass shootings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plant, operated by a private contractor with Army oversight, is now one of the country’s biggest manufacturers of commercial rounds for the popular AR-15, and it remains so even as the U.S. government supplies ammunition to Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A vast majority of Lake City rounds sold by retailers have been purchased by law-abiding citizens, including hunters, farmers and target shooters. Some of those people are drawn to the ammunition because it’s made with the same materials, and often to the same specifications, as the military’s. Others see the rounds as authentic accessories for their tactical weapons and gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than one million pages of search warrants, police evidence logs, ballistics reports, forfeiture records and court proceedings compiled by The Times provide a sweeping accounting of how Lake City ammunition, once intended for war, has also cut a criminal path through towns and cities in nearly all 50 states.\n",

      "\n",
      "The musical, “Harmony,” tells the story of the Comedian Harmonists, a singing group torn apart by the rise of Nazism and World War II. It is a decades-in-the-making labor of love for Manilow and his longtime collaborator Bruce Sussman, who first conceived of the show in the early 1990s. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Harmony” debuted in San Diego in 1997 to mixed reviews, and failed to transfer. A planned Broadway run evaporated when financial backing disintegrated. Many iterations of the musical followed, but Broadway deals fell apart. “It was so heartbreaking every time it didn’t make it,” Manilow, the singer, said in an interview. Now, the musical will at last have its moment on the Great White Way. \n",

      "For more than a century, Lessie Benningfield Randle, one of the last known survivors of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, has lived with the searing details of that spring. For decades, she has recalled the fire that ravaged her neighborhood, Greenwood, and the frantic trip with her grandmother to the safety of a fairground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Randle’s 109th birthday is Friday. She was 6 years old when a white mob attacked Greenwood with indiscriminate violence that wrought death and destruction and erased much of the promise of economic stability for future generations. She and the only other known survivor, Viola Fletcher, 109, are united in a historic legal battle to force the City of Tulsa and others to answer for the massacre.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would like to see justice. It’s past time. I would like to see this all cleared up and we go down the right road,” Randle said in an interview with The New York Times. “But I do not know if I will ever see that.”\n",

      "When @rebeccayarros pitched her publisher a sexy fantasy about telepathic dragons and their riders, she thought it might be a tough sell. However, “Fourth Wing” — an intricately plotted 500-plus-page narrative that takes place at an elite war college as two dragon riders feud, then fall in love — became a huge best seller. And on Tuesday, after much anticipation, the novel’s follow-up, “Iron Flame,” the second installment of a planned five-book series, is scheduled to publish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The runaway success of “Fourth Wing” stems in part from Yarros’s experience with chronic illness and her life in a military family, which she drew on while crafting the novel.\n",
      "“Writing Violet is super cathartic, because she struggles to accept the accommodations that are given to her, and I have that same struggle,” Yarros said in an interview with The New York Times.\n",

      "On a Saturday in October, in a small foundry, Erin Thompson watched as “a man in heat-resistant attire pulled down his gold-plated visor, turned on his plasma torch and sliced into the face of Robert E. Lee.” The statue had stood in Charlottesville, Va., since 1924 — and had been the subject of incredible controversy. A petition to remove the statue — organized by Zyahna Bryant in 2016 — led to a series of white nationalist rallies held to ensure it remained standing, which ultimately culminated in the death of counterprotester Heather D. Heyer. Now, a group called Swords Into Plowshares is repurposing the statues’ bronze to make a new piece of public art. “The way our communities dispose of these artifacts may influence America’s racial dynamic over the next century, just as erecting them did for the hundred-year period now ending,” @artcrimeprofessor writes. “99 years after the monument’s installation and 158 years after the end of the Civil War, it’s high time we start figuring this out.” Click the link in our bio to read more.| 📷 @ezeamosphotography and @audramelton #nytopinion\n",

      "At dusk on Saturday, devotees lit over 2.22 million lamps and kept them burning for 45 minutes as Hindu religious hymns filled the air at the banks of the river, setting a new world Record. Last year, over 1.5 million earthen lamps were lit.⁠\n",

A “hazardous” 400-500 level was recorded on the air quality index last week, more than 10 times the global safety threshold, which can cause acute and chronic bronchitis and asthma attacks. But on Saturday, unexpected rain and a strong wind improved the levels to 220, according to the government-run Central Pollution Control Board.⁠\n",
