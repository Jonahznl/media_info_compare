The first hints of Black solidarity with Palestinians started popping up in the mid-50s but it was first notably expressed when Malcolm X challenged Zionists‚Äô ‚Äúright‚Äù to take Palestine and uproot its people in a quote he gave to the Egyptian Gazette in 1964. In the 70s, the Black Panther Party would often use a picture of Leila Khaled, a fighter in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as imagery for an intercommunal fight against white supremacy. ‚Å£

Palestinians have also returned that support. In 2014, Palestinians reached out to BLM protesters in Ferguson and taught them how to deal with tear gas.

Children are particularly vulnerable, and early exposure to pollution can lead to lifelong health issues. While Indonesia has pledged to stop commissioning new coal-fired power plants from 2023 and be carbon neutral by 2050, its progress has been slow, leading to legal action.‚Å†

The majority of overdose deaths are due to illegally manufactured fentanyl, and overdose deaths from illegal synthetic opioids have increased 23 times higher in 2021 than in 2013.‚Å†

The US has imposed sanctions and indictments on Chinese companies and individuals for their involvement in the illegal trade of fentanyl. Fentanyl is easy to smuggle and can have disastrous effects, especially on new users.‚Å†

It can cause mental confusion, memory issues, drowsiness, nausea, and unconsciousness, with long-term effects risking heart failure, immune system suppression, anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders. ‚Å†

The increase in fentanyl-related deaths can be attributed to the 4 Ps of fentanyl: potency, production, profit, and packaging.‚Å†

‚ÄúCricket has a relatively high barrier to entry compared to most sports, simply due to the level of equipment required to play even a recreational game,‚Äù said Matt Roller, assistant editor at the ESPNCricinfo website. ‚ÄúIn my view, that is the principal reason that football has long been a global sport: All you need is a ball and any small space.‚Äù‚Å†
