American society, with no paid leave, a fragmented care system, and minimal discussion around aging and disability, is woefully ill-equipped to support tomorrow‚Äôs caregivers.

As the baby boomer generation enters the period of life when, statistically, most people need some form of care, more millennials, as well as Gen X and Gen Z Americans, will find themselves in a position of supporting an older relative.

For many, taking on the affairs of a parent or senior relative will add pressure on top of pressure. This is in part because Americans are having kids later in life, meaning they‚Äôre more likely to find themselves caring for elderly parents and young kids at the same time. Many caregivers are also likely to face unprecedented career and financial challenges, unable to afford to quit their jobs because they don‚Äôt have the accumulated wealth necessary to cushion any prolonged period of unemployment or to shoulder a relative‚Äôs expenses.

The elder care crisis is one that many people are finding themselves facing alone, with little support from policymakers, and little public conversation to tell them about what to expect. We can help. Head to the link in bio to read our new guide to caregiving.

‚Å†
First coined in the late 1990s, the term entered the zeitgeist earlier this year when ‚Äúpolycrisis‚Äù became a buzzword at the most recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. Its use evoked the world‚Äôs current tangled mess of problems ‚Äî pandemic, war, climate extremes, energy shortages, inflation, rising authoritarianism, and the like ‚Äî and it caught on.‚Å†
‚Å†
Criticism has multiplied since then, as have crises, such as the violence now convulsing Israel and Gaza. Those on the political center and right say sure, a lot of bad stuff is happening in the world, but that‚Äôs always been the case. Meanwhile, critics on the left say that the polycrisis idea distracts attention, perhaps deliberately, from the real driver of humanity‚Äôs traumas: relentless, predatory, globalized capitalism. The ruckus, though, suggests the term tapping into some irksome truths. Read the full story at the link in bio.‚Å†

The one currently unfolding in Gaza, where at least 200 abductees including elderly people, women, and children are believed to be held, is ‚Äúwithout question the most difficult hostage situation Israel has ever faced,‚Äù as Michael Milstein, an analyst at Israel‚Äôs Reichman University, put it.‚Å†
‚Å†
The hostage-taking, which coincided with what many are calling the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, would be painful enough in its own right. Some experts say a ground invasion into Gaza is likely the only way to get the hostages out, but such a rescue operation presents major intelligence and logistical challenges. Many of the captives are believed to be held in Hamas‚Äôs extensive underground tunnel network, which the militants use to run military operations, evade detection, and store weapons. Israeli officials have warned that a ground invasion will force soldiers to face the risk of ambushes and booby traps in a dark, unfamiliar terrain that is believed to stretch 300 miles.‚Å†

Nobody knows for sure, and that‚Äôs a problem facing everyone, from regular people wanting to spend a few bucks on charity to governments with millions to invest in public policy. 

Economists love things they can measure objectively, like the number of deaths in a village or the number of dollars in an account. So over the past century, they‚Äôve focused on measuring health and wealth. The best policy programs for society are deemed to be the ones that save the most lives, say, or increase gross domestic product (GDP) by the widest margin. And there‚Äôs a good rationale for using a metric like GDP as a short-hand for well-being: There is a very high correlation between a nation‚Äôs GDP per capita and its self-reported life satisfaction.

But as we‚Äôve gathered more data on the happiness of different populations, it‚Äôs become clear that increasing wealth and health do not always go hand in hand with increasing happiness. By the economists‚Äô objective measures, people in rich countries like the US should be doing great ‚Äî and yet Americans are only becoming more miserable. And people in some higher-GDP European countries like Portugal and Italy report lower life satisfaction than people in lower-GDP Latin American countries. What‚Äôs going on here?

As the hospitals, homes, schools, and streets of the south fill up with the displaced and injured, time is running out to get lifesaving aid in ‚Äî or to help people, including hundreds of US citizens, leave.

US citizens in Gaza were told Saturday to move closer to the #Rafah border crossing, only for them to be unable to evacuate as southern Gaza becomes more and more crowded ‚Äî and runs low on basic supplies.

The status of the border crossing has been somewhat muddled; Egypt says its side remains open but that Israeli Air Force bombardments on the Gaza side of the crossing have stopped the flow of traffic and kept the border crossing closed. But Egyptian security officials also told @Reuters they are holding up the planned evacuation of some Gazans, including foreign citizens, as they await a deal to allow aid into Gaza.

‚ÄúEvery hour these supplies remain on the Egyptian side of the border, more girls and boys, women and men, especially those vulnerable or disabled, will die,‚Äù @WHO said in a statement Saturday.

But as aid negotiations continue, the question of what happens for Gazans as Israel launches its ‚Äúnext stage‚Äù of the war remains: Will powers with competing relationships and interests be able to negotiate some measure of safety for civilians, and will this next phase of the war create more Palestinian refugees, who may never be able to return to their homes?

The situation on the ground in Gaza is ‚Äúfast becoming untenable,‚Äù Martin Griffiths, the @un_ocha chief, said in a statement Saturday. 

On Monday, the Israeli government shut off Gaza‚Äôs access to water, electricity, and fuel as part of its declared siege of the region. Gaza has been under blockade by both Israel and Egypt since 2007, and access to basic goods, including food and medicine, is available only via the UN and nongovernmental organizations.

‚ÄúI fear that the worst is yet to come,‚Äù Griffiths added.

Since Hamas, the militant Islamic group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, launched an unprecedented and brutal attack against Israel that killed at least 1,300 people a week ago, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has dropped at least 6,000 bombs over Gaza. Those operations have so far killed more than 1,500 Palestinians, including civilians. Meanwhile, an IDF ground invasion seems imminent.

More than 2 million Gazans live in a strip of land the size of Philadelphia, making it one of the most densely populated places on the planet, which increases the possibility of hitting civilians during military operations. And about 42.5 percent of the population is under the age of 14, making childhood casualties common in times of conflict.

Supplies like food, fuel, medicine, and clean water are already running critically low in the region, and as of yet, since borders remain closed, there is no humanitarian corridor to get supplies into Gaza ‚Äî or get people out.

Since 2017, Israel‚Äôs government has worked both to de facto annex the West Bank and rapidly expand Jewish settlement. Instead of breaking the Palestinians‚Äô spirit as intended, atrocities by emboldened settler extremists ignited Palestinian anger. And atrocities committed by Palestinians led to settler retaliation, creating an unstable situation requiring a significant redeployment of Israel Defense Forces resources to the West Bank ‚Äî whose raids themselves became a source of Palestinian grievance.

Oversharing in conversation is nothing new. Throughout thousands of years of social interaction, people have divulged certain secrets, vulnerabilities, and desires to perhaps the wrong listener, with results ranging from mild embarrassment to shattered reputations. Thanks to social media, the ability to make these confessions to a potentially much wider audience is easier than ever.‚Å†
‚Å†
What isn‚Äôt as straightforward is defining what constitutes oversharing online. Each platform has its specific norms and users who have their own opinions on what content they consider too cringe or vulnerable for public consumption. For instance, when people express negative emotions on Facebook, it doesn‚Äôt seem so out of place, according to a 2017 study. On the contrary, Instagram is where users expect to see positive content ‚Äî albeit content that isn‚Äôt particularly authentic. One study, from 2021, suggests the norms on TikTok empower users to embrace both difficult and positive experiences when they post.‚Å†
‚Å†
However, as social media continues to occupy an increasingly intimate space in our lives, as Ysabel Gerrard, a senior lecturer in digital communication at the University of Sheffield, thinks it will, what we post ‚Äî and how audiences interpret it ‚Äî will shift. Gerrard, who studies young people‚Äôs experiences of social media and digital identities, says that when social platforms become a place to store meaningful memories, the way we post will only become more personal. But does this give us permission to post through it? Read the full story at the link in bio.‚Å†

voxdotcom,CyGoA1rs2b0,2023-10-07 16:00:49,GraphImage,"In recent decades, parenting styles have shifted away from ‚Äúchildren should be seen and not heard‚Äù toward a family dynamic where children‚Äôs voices and opinions are valued, but a tension remains regarding the balance between parental authority and childhood inclusivity. In particular, this question endures: Should you be friends with your kid?‚Å†
‚Å†
Part of the issue is the vagueness of the question: What does friendship with a child actually look like? Does being friends with your kids mean simply having fun together, or does it signify a relationship of equals? The American Psychological Association defines friendship as ‚Äúa voluntary relationship between two or more people that is relatively long-lasting and in which those involved tend to be concerned with meeting the others‚Äô needs and interests as well as satisfying their own desires.‚Äù Parenting, however, isn‚Äôt voluntary, and a child shouldn‚Äôt be interested in meeting their parents‚Äô needs.‚Å†
‚Å†
While experts stress the importance of a warm and supportive relationship with children, they say parents must maintain authority over their kids, which is directly at odds with the ideals of friendship. At its core, friendship is elective and equal. Once you‚Äôre a parent, there‚Äôs no opting out, making friendship not exactly appropriate for parents and their kids. So, should parents be friends with their little ones? In short: No. But you can still maintain aspects of friendship while remaining in the driver‚Äôs seat with little ones.

‚Å†
In fact, embracing nature has increasingly become something akin to pay-to-play. From trailhead parking to state park passes and national park entry fees, the price of heading into the wilderness can be prohibitive, especially for those who cannot access the woods without a car due to a lack of transport infrastructure. Those prices also don‚Äôt include accommodation costs, which can run upward of $500 a night for a hotel room near the Grand Canyon or an Airbnb near Lake Tahoe.‚Å†
‚Å†
Data backs this up. The outdoor industry is projected to reach revenues of $22.9 billion from US consumers this year. If you think about it hard enough, you can start to believe you need a lot of things (and to spend a lot of money) before heading out into the great outdoors. How can we make the great outdoors more accessible for all? Find out at the link in bio.‚Å†

voxdotcom,CyBedk0N_9n,2023-10-05 16:01:28,GraphImage,"Paxlovid is currently the most effective antiviral medication on the market for treating and reducing the severity of outpatient Covid-19 infections. The drug is @FDA approved to treat infection only in people at high risk for being hospitalized or dying as a result of Covid-19 infection ‚Äî that is, those over 65 or with certain chronic medical conditions. But there‚Äôs reason to believe that Paxlovid could have big benefits for younger, healthier people too. ‚Å†
‚Å†
A small body of literature suggests that the drug‚Äôs effects may make it a good strategy for shortening the course of illness, reducing transmissibility, and lowering the risk of #LongCovid. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Although there‚Äôs no shortage of Paxlovid in the US, the drug has been underused among the high-risk populations that would derive the greatest good from its use. But we also might be underusing it in the lower-risk people in whom the drug hasn‚Äôt been as rigorously studied ‚Äî but who could have other benefits from its use.‚Å†

‚Å†
If you are a connoisseur of fancy coffee and fancy coffee shops (or even just fancy-ish), you‚Äôve probably noticed that the price of your favorite drink is higher than it used to be. Nowadays, the base price for a regular latte is something like $6, then maybe you add in vanilla syrup, which costs you an extra dollar, and ask for oat milk, which is a dollar more. You‚Äôre now staring at an $8 drink, plus taxes and, assuming you‚Äôre doing the right thing here, at least a $1 tip.‚Å†
‚Å†
What, you might be asking yourself, is going on here? You are not alone. ‚ÄúWhy is my latte so expensive?‚Äù is indeed a perennial question. And to that question, at least the 2023 version, we‚Äôve got answers. You can find them at the link in bio.‚Å†

The vote was the result of a charge led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) to strip McCarthy of the speakership after he cut a deal with Democrats to fund the government for another 45 days, just before it otherwise would have shut down. Gaetz brought a motion to vacate on the House floor Monday night, a procedural move that has never before been successfully used to oust a speaker.

As Taylor Swift makes appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games and rumors swirl that she‚Äôs dating tight end Travis Kelce, a marketing gold mine has sprung up. The buzz is inescapable, whether you‚Äôre a #swiftie, an NFL fan, both, or neither. 

In fact, Kelce‚Äôs jersey sales have spiked, as has the number of his Instagram followers. Game viewership has jumped as Swift fans tune in to catch a glimpse of her, and NFL games are already the most-watched programs on TV anyway. The social media chatter is endless. The media coverage is breathless.

voxdotcom,Cx5wJ_Uy_Gg,2023-10-02 16:01:50,GraphImage,"Like it so often does, TikTok has figured out a way to siphon the joy away from something crucial. This time, it‚Äôs complaining and gossiping about your friends. The social media platform that has emboldened regular people to turn into front-facing-camera personalities has spurred some of these characters to eavesdrop and then snitch on random gossipers.‚Å†
‚Å†
These TikTokers are something like vigilantes on a mission. One poster asked their audience to find Sarah, a young woman whose friends were overheard rehashing her bad behavior; another set her followers to track down a bride whose bridesmaids hated their dresses. They present a kind of moral imperative: These women deserve to know what their friends have to say about them. Hundreds of thousands of views roll in, setting off an internet-wide hunt for the people in question, with all the social-media shaming that entails.‚Å†
‚Å†
What these video creators ‚Äî who are eavesdropping on, recording, and posting about total strangers ‚Äî and the people consuming their TikToks fail to realize is that they‚Äôre partaking in the gossip they're denouncing. The illusion of righteousness also eclipses the somewhat uncomfortable fact that pettily complaining and gossiping about others is actually a normal ‚Äî even healthy ‚Äî facet of the vast majority of relationships.
