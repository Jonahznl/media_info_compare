The projectile seen in the video is most likely not what caused the explosion at the hospital.

The contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch is to blame remains plausible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.\\n\\nThe hospital blast has become a searing, contested episode in the war that began on Oct. 7, after Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, invaded Israel, killing more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers and seizing 200 hostages who were taken back to Gaza, according to the Israeli government.

But even Alghorra—who has already lived through the devastating 2008 and 2014 Gaza-Israel conflicts—was not prepared for what has transpired this month. “The humanitarian situation here is extremely catastrophic,” Alghorra tells TIME.\\n\\nAlghorra’s photographs show how Israeli airstrikes continue to overwhelm the 2.2 million Palestinians living in what is one of the world’s most densely populated places. Families grieve next to lifeless bodies. Plumes of smoke fill the sky. Rubble fills the streets. Patients inundate Al-Shifa, the city’s largest medical complex, as thousands more seek shelter there. Homes are destroyed every day. “They are reduced to dismembered bodies inside,” he says.\\n\\nAnd those who live have not escaped the trauma. Alghorra recalls meeting two children at the emergency room at Al-Quds hospital who had lost their father while escaping airstrikes. “They sat there crying. We tried to help find [him],” he says. Alghorra followed them until they finally found him injured in a different part of the hospital. “They hugged each other and collapsed in tears.”\\n\\nA photographer captures death, destruction, and grief in Gaza — at the link in bio.\\n\\nPhotographs by Saher Alghorra (@saher_alghorra)—Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images',\n",

While those with enough fuel have made the journey by car or truck, others have hitched rides on trailers and donkey carts. Some have even resorted to making the perilous journey on foot.\\n\\nThis kind of mass relocation of civilians amid regular airstrikes was never going to be easy. Both the United Nations and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders dubbed the task “impossible,” citing the logistical nightmare of relocating half of Gaza’s population—among them women, children, and the elderly—without any guarantees for their safety.
